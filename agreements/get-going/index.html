Plan your lab portfolio</h4> <p>With your brand new data space in place, now is the time to recap your tactics on how to manage data and teams to provide prosperous environments in sync with your scientific vision. Digital laboratories are great at both bringing teams together and to separate activities when needed.</p> <p><em>One or several labs?</em></p> <p>Reasons to keep your activities together may be unity, simplicity, and cost. Reasons to segregate data and/or activities may be requirements from ethical committees and privacy officers, to limit data access between teams, data safety and reliability, separation of cost or governance, specify tools or activities, provide freedom for early-investigators on your team to develop independence and so forth.</p> <p><a href="/contact">Contact us </a> if you think we can assist in your evaluation, and keep in mind that you can add more labs later.</p> <h4 id="_2-identify-your-lab-team"><a href="#_2-identify-your-lab-team" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Identify your lab team</h4> <p>For each lab, identify one lab leader and one lab coordinator that will manage day-to-day activities in your lab, including adding new lab users and adjusting lab resources. The lab leader and lab coordinator are our point of contact in the lab for dialogue and help, as well as the point of contact for your data space coordinator team.</p> <h4 id="_3-brand-your-lab"><a href="#_3-brand-your-lab" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Brand your lab</h4> <p>For each lab, and together with your new lab team, invest some time to identify a cool, catchy or powerful name for your lab. The name of your new &quot;scientific instrument&quot; may help strengthen your scientific brand when you communicate with colleagues, collaborators and other interested parties.</p> <h4 id="_4-plan-your-lab-resources"><a href="#_4-plan-your-lab-resources" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Plan your lab resources</h4> <p>For each lab, and together with your lab team, approximate your initial requirements for storage (in terabytes) and computational power (in <a href="/services/machine-types/">machine types</a>) that fits your planned experiments. Keep in mind that storage can be increased later -not decreased- and that machine types can be adjusted up and down throughout your lab's life cycle.</p> <p>For each machine type, decide if you want to commit the resource allocation for 1 year or 3 years, or if you want to utilize flexible on-demand resources as summarized in our <a href="/prices/introduction">prices introduction</a>, detailed in our <a href="/services/specifications/">services specifications</a> and priced in our <a href="/prices/pricelist/">price list</a>.</p> <p><a href="/contact">Contact us </a> for guidance on both generic and tailored setups if you think we may help.</p> <h4 id="_5-prepare-your-lab-order"><a href="#_5-prepare-your-lab-order" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5.

Prepare your user agreements</h4> <p>The lab leader in each lab is responsible for the identification and verification of individual lab users that they authorize access to the lab that they manage. Such authorizations are documented in individual user agreements. Lab users need individual user agreements for each lab that they will access.</p> <ul><li>Download the &quot;<a href="/agreements/downloads/#user-agreement">User agreement</a>&quot; on your local machine (right click on the link and select &quot;Save Link As...&quot;).</li> <li>Open the PDF on your local machine and either (i) print and complete the fields by hand or (i) open in an PDF-editor and complete the fields digitally.
