# CUDA

Have you already got access to your [GPU machine](/do-science/tools/technical/gpu/#gpu-models)?

Following this guide you can install multiple [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/doc/index.html) versions at the same time. Each version will be installed in the separate directory.

::: tip

You don’t need to use `sudo` to install **[CUDA Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/doc/index.html)** and **[cuDNN](https://docs.nvidia.com/cudnn/index.html)**.

:::

You will be able to use activation scripts to switch between them.

Choose one of the versions listed in the menu and proceed with the guide.
