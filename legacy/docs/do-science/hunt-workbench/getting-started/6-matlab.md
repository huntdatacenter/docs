# MATLAB

**You can run MATLAB both from Jupyterlab or from the remote desktop (VNC) in your Workbench.**

To be able to run MATLAB in Workbench you need to bring your own license. In most cases such license is already provided by your institution and you can request it from your IT department.

::: tip NTNU employees

We already have the license for NTNU employees and it should already be in your workbench, if you can't find it, send us a message through general service request in [do science Service desk](https://docs.hdc.ntnu.no/do-science/service-desk/#tingweek:~:text=data%20space%20subscription.-,%23,-General%20service%20request).

### In JupyterLab

MATLAB installation in Workbench comes with the MATLAB kernel, you can read about it [on this page](https://blogs.mathworks.com/matlab/2023/01/30/official-mathworks-matlab-kernel-for-jupyter-released/).

### In Remote desktop

MATLAB is available in your Workbench VNC desktop under the "Education" tab.
