# Consent information

**You will need a valid consent to join our community.**



### How to consent

We will send you a consent link together with your onboarding information when you register as a new user. 

This link is unique to you and will take you to a consent page where you can submit your consent. We will send you a Slack access link as soon as we have registered your consent, typically within the same or next day. 

The community membership is for you, so you don't need to reconsent for each lab. We will automatically include you in additional lab channels when you join new labs.
