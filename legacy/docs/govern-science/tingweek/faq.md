## About the Tingweek

### Why Tings?

The inspiration to appoint time to meet at regular intervals in a layered structure is drawn from the Old Norse [ting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_(assembly)#Etymology) structures such as [Frostating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostating) here in Trøndelag. The intention is to ensure regular discussions on how we can together elevate data for a better world, including feedback on how to best adapt and evolve the scientific toolbox of HUNT Cloud to better support your scientific journey.

### Is this an assembly?

No. Our tings are not the same as a general assembly (generalforsamling) with binding decisions. As of today, our tings are to be seen as a gathering of people that both champion and dream up ideas on how to best utilize data for a better world. HUNT Cloud is owned by NTNU which has the full financial and compliance responsibilities for our services.

## Participation

### About the Lagtun name

We know, Lagtun is difficult to pronounce in English. However, in Norwegian it is a word with several meanings that we think capture the soul of this Ting. 

First, **Lag** means "law" In Old Norse. This meaning is included in the last part of the name of our region, Trøndelag, which means the law of the Trønders. In addition, "lag" means "team" in modern Norwegian, reflecting the collaborative nature of the ting. 

The second part, **tun** is also an Old Norse word for a fenced in area, usually around a collection of farm houses, much like you're fenced in lab machines. Also relevant, the old tings were held on fenced in tuns where the Vikings had to leave all weapons by the fence before they entered the ting.
