The decision to choose a WHITE, ORANGE or BLUE subscription level is fully up to you and your data space leader. Head over to the <a href="/administer-science/services/overview#data-space-subscription">services overview</a> to see the differences between them.</p><h2 id="compute" tabindex="-1">Compute <a class="header-anchor" href="#compute" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Compute&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="are-entry-machines-metered" tabindex="-1">Are entry machines metered? <a class="header-anchor" href="#are-entry-machines-metered" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Are entry machines metered?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>No. Entry machines are the machines we use to control the user management and security updates in individual labs. These are mandatory and the cost is included in lab subscription fees. You should -not- include the cost for these machines in your <a href="/administer-science/prices/calculator">price calculator</a> estimates.</p><h3 id="can-we-upsize-a-commitment-machine-with-on-demand-resources" tabindex="-1">Can we upsize a commitment machine with on-demand resources? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-we-upsize-a-commitment-machine-with-on-demand-resources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can we upsize a commitment machine with on-demand resources?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes, that&#39;s the aim. We acknowledge that you may have a need for increased computational resources in periods of the year, and that one convenient setup would be to upsize your home machine for such compute efforts. Our aim is to allow such upgrades.</p><h3 id="how-do-we-ensure-that-on-demand-machines-are-deactivated-when-not-needed" tabindex="-1">How do we ensure that on-demand machines are deactivated when not needed? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-we-ensure-that-on-demand-machines-are-deactivated-when-not-needed" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do we ensure that on-demand machines are deactivated when not needed?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>On-demand resources runs until a deactivation notice from the a lab user. To save cost, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> for deactivation when the machine is no longer needed. The meter stops the day we get the notification.</p><h2 id="storage" tabindex="-1">Storage <a class="header-anchor" href="#storage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Storage&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="which-terabyte-price-will-each-lab-pay-for-their-storage" tabindex="-1">Which terabyte price will each lab pay for their storage? <a class="header-anchor" href="#which-terabyte-price-will-each-lab-pay-for-their-storage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Which terabyte price will each lab pay for their storage?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Each lab pay the mean terabyte price for your data space. We automatically calculate the volume discount for your data space and use this set the mean terabyte price for your data space. For details, see the meter, cost and billing section under the Store chapter in the <a href="/administer-science/services/specifications">services specification</a> and the Store section in the <a href="/administer-science/prices/pricelist">price list</a>, or test for yourself in the <a href="/administer-science/prices/calculator">price calculator</a>.</p><h3 id="why-is-one-terabyte-the-minimum-storage-allocation" tabindex="-1">Why is one terabyte the minimum storage allocation? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-one-terabyte-the-minimum-storage-allocation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why is one terabyte the minimum storage allocation?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We try ensure a consistent storage performance by linking usage to the overall system capacity. One of these controls is to ensure that the total number of spinning disks scale with the need for increased input/output operations of actual use. The one terabyte minimum allocation helps us to achieve this.</p><h3 id="why-to-we-see-less-storage-on-our-machines-that-we-pay-for" tabindex="-1">Why to we see less storage on our machines that we pay for? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-to-we-see-less-storage-on-our-machines-that-we-pay-for" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why to we see less storage on our machines that we pay for?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The volumes sizes that you see on your machines are slightly less that the volume sizes that you claim. This is expected. <a href="/administer-science/data/faq#why-is-volume-sizes-less-than-claimed">Read why here</a>.</p><h3 id="how-is-storage-reduction-metered" tabindex="-1">How is storage reduction metered? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-is-storage-reduction-metered" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How is storage reduction metered?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You can indirectly reduce the size of your storage volume by moving data to a new smaller volume (<a href="/administer-science/data/faq#can-we-reduce-the-size-of-existing-volumes">see the steps here</a>). During such procedures, both volumes are metered until you request deletion of the original volume in the service desk.</p><h2 id="billing" tabindex="-1">Billing <a class="header-anchor" href="#billing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Billing&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="when-should-we-expect-our-invoices" tabindex="-1">When should we expect our invoices? <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-should-we-expect-our-invoices" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When should we expect our invoices?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We have a clear intention to ship quarterly invoices with shipments approximately two weeks after the quarter ends.

All accrued costs for the specified labs (one or more) will then be invoiced to the new profile.</p><h3 id="how-can-we-update-the-account-information-on-the-invoice-profile" tabindex="-1">How can we update the account information on the invoice profile? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-can-we-update-the-account-information-on-the-invoice-profile" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How can we update the account information on the invoice profile?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You may update existing invoice profiles in the data space management section of our <a href="/administer-science/service-desk/data-space-orders#update-existing-invoice-profile">service desk</a>.</p><h3 id="we-are-invoiced-too-much-now-what" tabindex="-1">We are invoiced too much, now what? <a class="header-anchor" href="#we-are-invoiced-too-much-now-what" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;We are invoiced too much, now what?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Although we are doing over very best to ensure accurate amounts on the invoices, we are aware that the amounts may sometimes be inaccurate. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> if you expect that you are invoice the wrong amount.

Therefore, the price will change if the total storage volume of your data space change during the quarter or if the price list change during the quarter. Each volume may therefore be listed several times with varying number of &quot;unit days&quot;.</p><h3 id="when-should-we-expect-commit-services-to-be-invoices" tabindex="-1">When should we expect &quot;commit services&quot; to be invoices? <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-should-we-expect-commit-services-to-be-invoices" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When should we expect &quot;commit services&quot; to be invoices?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Commit services are those your commit to 1 or 3 years. You should expect the next invoice after you order the service to include the full commit price for data space subscriptions, lab subscriptions and 1Y/3Y commitments of machines and storage.
