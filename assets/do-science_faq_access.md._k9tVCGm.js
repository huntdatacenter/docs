We allow you to configure several local computers to connect to your lab, for example both your laptop and desktop machine. Each machine needs to be configured with a VPN certificate and SSH. Start from step 2, <a href="/do-science/lab/">Configure your VPN</a> in our Getting started guide to get going.
