This means that we cannot sign data processor agreements between NTNU departments.</p><p>To allow for documented security measures, we have therefore developed a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) for internal data processing that we call &quot;enighetsavtale&quot;. We sign these at the Department level.</p><p>The document clarifies the same rights and protections as our regular processor agreement with one exception: Disputes will be resolved with binding effect by NTNU&#39;s management with our Rector as the last instance.</p><h2 id="data-subprocessor-agreement" tabindex="-1">Data subprocessor agreement <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-subprocessor-agreement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data subprocessor agreement&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Sometimes you may be processing data on behalf of others.

If so, HUNT Cloud may be the &quot;data subprocessor&quot; (data underbehandler).

This is fine with us as long as the template is compliant with requirements set forth in GDPR, other relevant laws, ISO 27001 and 27701, and that we are able to comply with your organization&#39;s security requirements.</p><p>Note that such templates will need involvement from legal teams from both sides. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> for time estimates of such arrangements.</p>',27)])])}const m=a(n,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
