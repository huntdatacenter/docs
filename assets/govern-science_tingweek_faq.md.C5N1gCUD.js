The intention is to ensure regular discussions on how we can together elevate data for a better world, including feedback on how to best adapt and evolve the scientific toolbox of HUNT Cloud to better support your scientific journey.</p><h3 id="is-this-an-assembly" tabindex="-1">Is this an assembly? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-this-an-assembly" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is this an assembly?&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>No. Our tings are not the same as a general assembly (generalforsamling) with binding decisions. As of today, our tings are to be seen as a gathering of people that both champion and dream up ideas on how to best utilize data for a better world. HUNT Cloud is owned by NTNU which has the full financial and compliance responsibilities for our services.</p><h2 id="participation" tabindex="-1">Participation <a class="header-anchor" href="#participation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Participation&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><h3 id="short-on-time-which-ting-should-i-prioritize" tabindex="-1">Short on time, which Ting should I prioritize? <a class="header-anchor" href="#short-on-time-which-ting-should-i-prioritize" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Short on time, which Ting should I prioritize?&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>All where you are invited ðŸ˜‰ That said, we know science never sleeps, so if you are short on time and hold several roles and such receive several invitations: Here&#39;s a quick reminder of the scope of the different meetings to help you prioritize.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="&quot;Tingweek schedule&quot;"></p><p>You can read more about the different Tings in our <a href="/govern-science/tingweek/#tings">main Tingweek page</a>.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-get-my-invitation" tabindex="-1">How do I get my invitation? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-get-my-invitation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do I get my invitation?&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Ting invitations, agenda and digital meeting links are forwarded on email a few weeks before the Tingweek.

If you are interested in the resolutions, we recommend that you prioritize the first hour (9-10 am) where we aim to complete most of the structured agenda.

However, in Norwegian it is a word with several meanings that we think capture the soul of this Ting.</p><p>First, <strong>Lag</strong> means &quot;law&quot; In Old Norse. This meaning is included in the last part of the name of our region, TrÃ¸ndelag, which means the law of the TrÃ¸nders. In addition, &quot;lag&quot; means &quot;team&quot; in modern Norwegian, reflecting the collaborative nature of the ting.</p><p>The second part, <strong>tun</strong> is also an Old Norse word for a fenced in area, usually around a collection of farm houses, much like you&#39;re fenced in lab machines. Also relevant, the old tings were held on fenced in tuns where the Vikings had to leave all weapons by the fence before they entered the ting.</p>',30)])])}const m=t(r,[["render",h]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
