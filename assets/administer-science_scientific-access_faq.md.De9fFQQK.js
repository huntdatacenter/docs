The starting point for access to HUNT Cloud depends on your role: Organizations starts with <a href="/govern-science/organizational-access/">organizational access</a>, scientific centers and groups start with <a href="/administer-science/scientific-access/">scientific access</a> and scientists starts with <a href="/administer-science/service-desk/lab-orders#add-a-new-lab-user">lab access</a>. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> if you need guidance.</p><h3 id="do-we-need-all-agreement-layers" tabindex="-1">Do we need all agreement layers? <a class="header-anchor" href="#do-we-need-all-agreement-layers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Do we need all agreement layers?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes. All labs needs to run under a complete <a href="/administer-science/agreements/overview#overview">agreement layer</a> so we can ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations and certificates. We know, this is slightly complex. On the bright side, the agreements create a solid base to organize and expand your scientific activities.</p><h3 id="why-do-we-need-these-agreement-layers" tabindex="-1">Why do we need these agreement layers? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-do-we-need-these-agreement-layers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why do we need these agreement layers?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Our <a href="/administer-science/agreements/overview#overview">agreement structure</a> has evolved over time to allow high variability in activities and preferences among our member organizations. We know, this is a mouthful if you need access to one lab only. However, once you get going with the terminology and structure we hope you will enjoy the flexibility. The layered structure is utilized both for governance, reporting, incentives and to comply with laws and regulations.</p><h2 id="data-space-agreement" tabindex="-1">Data space agreement <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-space-agreement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data space agreement&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="what-is-our-service-center-name" tabindex="-1">What is our Service center name? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-our-service-center-name" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is our Service center name?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><a href="/contact">Contact us</a> for a quick clarification if you are unsure of your Service center name and leader as this may vary depending on your host organization.
