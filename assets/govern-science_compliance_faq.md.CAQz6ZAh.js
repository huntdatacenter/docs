We encourage data controllers to audit our systems to ensure that they are implemented and operated as we state in our policies.

Representatives from our data controllers may join one or more of our internal audits for educational purposes. We provide this service to elevate and strengthen the audit expertise in your team. These sessions differ from an audit that you conduct in that it will be headed by our compliance officer and the audit program will be defined by us. You can choose if you would like to observe or join the auditor team alongside our compliance officer. On your request, we may arrange a pre-audit session where we discuss ISO standards, compliance criteria, common audit techniques, reporting and internal follow-ups. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> for arrangements.</p>',17)])])}const m=e(r,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
