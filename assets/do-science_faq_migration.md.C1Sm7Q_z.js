All labs will be migrated over here in 2024. You should plan for few days of downtime. We will schedule the migration with individual labs to avoid conflicts with scientific deadlines. Data on home machines will be migrated automatically, and on a case-by-case basis for unmanaged machines. You will need to reconfigure custom software installation and reset your lab password.</p></div><h2 id="general" tabindex="-1">General <a class="header-anchor" href="#general" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;General&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="why-do-we-need-to-migrate" tabindex="-1">Why do we need to migrate? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-do-we-need-to-migrate" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why do we need to migrate?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We have a shiny new server room with new and upgraded equipment. This means more flexibility and capacity for your scientific experiments. At the same time this means more space for us in our original location to start planning the next generation of services.</p><h3 id="can-we-migrate-part-of-the-lab" tabindex="-1">Can we migrate part of the lab? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-we-migrate-part-of-the-lab" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can we migrate part of the lab?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Unfortunately not.

We aim to avoid conflicts with your internal deadline such as papers, conferences, grants etc. to the extent possible. We will reach out to BLUE and ORANGE data spaces to schedule the migration accordance to their preferences. We will also try to accommodate requests for labs in WHITE data spaces to the extent possible.</p><h3 id="we-are-supposed-to-receive-a-big-dataset-should-we-ask-for-a-prioritization" tabindex="-1">We are supposed to receive a big dataset, should we ask for a prioritization? <a class="header-anchor" href="#we-are-supposed-to-receive-a-big-dataset-should-we-ask-for-a-prioritization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;We are supposed to receive a big dataset, should we ask for a prioritization?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes!

However, be aware that the GPU availability differ slightly in the new location. We will migrate most P100 and V100S users to A30 or A40 GPUs.</p><h2 id="before-migration" tabindex="-1">Before migration <a class="header-anchor" href="#before-migration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Before migration&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="do-we-need-to-prepare-something-before-the-migration" tabindex="-1">Do we need to prepare something before the migration? <a class="header-anchor" href="#do-we-need-to-prepare-something-before-the-migration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Do we need to prepare something before the migration?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes, if you have <code>cargo</code>-volumes and unmanaged machines in your lab. Worry not, we will contact your lab leader will further details if this is the case. In short, you will need to remove data from your cargo-volumes as these will be discontinued, and decide if you want storage volumes for unmanaged machines to be migrated or not.</p><h3 id="will-our-home-machine-be-the-same-after-the-migration" tabindex="-1">Will our home machine be the same after the migration? <a class="header-anchor" href="#will-our-home-machine-be-the-same-after-the-migration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Will our home machine be the same after the migration?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>No. You will get a new home machine with a new Ubuntu operating system (22.04 LTS). You will need to install and configure software that you have installed on your current home machine.</p><h3 id="will-our-conda-environments-on-our-home-machine-work-after-the-new-migration" tabindex="-1">Will our Conda environments on our home machine work after the new migration? <a class="header-anchor" href="#will-our-conda-environments-on-our-home-machine-work-after-the-new-migration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Will our Conda environments on our home machine work after the new migration?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes, we expect that the Conda environments will work. We will migrate the storage volume on your home machine where these are stored.</p><h3 id="will-our-apt-and-snap-packages-on-home-be-migrated" tabindex="-1">Will our apt and snap packages on home be migrated? <a class="header-anchor" href="#will-our-apt-and-snap-packages-on-home-be-migrated" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Will our apt and snap packages on home be migrated?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>No. We will install a clean operating system, transfer your data and configure your current lab users. You need to install your preferred apt and snap packages yourself. We can send you a list of apt and snap packages installed after migration if you ask us on slack or email.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-know-if-my-apt-packages-are-supported-in-ubuntu-22-04" tabindex="-1">How do I know if my apt-packages are supported in Ubuntu 22.04? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-know-if-my-apt-packages-are-supported-in-ubuntu-22-04" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do I know if my apt-packages are supported in Ubuntu 22.04?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Some of your current apt-packages may depend on older Linux version.

We will migrate your storage volumes to the new location. This means that your data should be the same. For unmanaged machines, you will be asked to choose if you want data to be migrated or if you want a fresh storage volume.</p><h3 id="will-our-cpu-machine-types-be-the-same" tabindex="-1">Will our CPU machine types be the same? <a class="header-anchor" href="#will-our-cpu-machine-types-be-the-same" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Will our CPU machine types be the same?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes. We aim to move you to a new compute machine with the same machine type that you have today. However, the operating system will be fresh installation. Therefore, you will need to install and configure software that you have previously installed in your current lab.</p><h3 id="will-our-gpu-machines-be-the-same" tabindex="-1">Will our GPU machines be the same? <a class="header-anchor" href="#will-our-gpu-machines-be-the-same" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Will our GPU machines be the same?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>No. The GPU availability differ slightly between the two locations.

We will start the migration of your storage volumes and other configurations while you work in your current lab. When these initial transfers and configurations are completed, we will finalize your installation. Both your old and new lab will be unavailable during this step to avoid inconsistency in your data.</p><h3 id="how-long-will-the-migration-last" tabindex="-1">How long will the migration last? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-long-will-the-migration-last" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How long will the migration last?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We expect your lab to be unavailable for about 1 day while we finalize your migration.</p><h2 id="after-migration" tabindex="-1">After migration <a class="header-anchor" href="#after-migration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;After migration&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="can-we-log-directly-into-our-migrated-lab" tabindex="-1">Can we log directly into our migrated lab? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-we-log-directly-into-our-migrated-lab" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can we log directly into our migrated lab?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>No. All lab users need to update their lab IP, reset their SSH passphrase and install a new Workbench certificate.
