# Contribute

**We are proud of the content on these pages. They have gradually evolved from dialogues, reflections and contributions by our scientific community.**

However, they are by no means perfect. We know it's frustrating when you don't find a fix to your problem. Here are a few ways that you can help the next scientist in line with your hard earned knowledge and expertise:

- **Suggest new content.** Suggest ideas for new content that will help science fly, either in our Tings, by email or in Slack. Also, keep asking us questions to improve the [FAQ section](/faq/) and tell us about troubles to improve the [troubleshooting section](/troubleshooting/).

- **Improve current content.** Improve the text directly on a page by clicking the **`Help us improve this page!`** link at the bottom of each page or create an issue on our [issue page](https://github.com/huntdatacenter/docs/issues). Please note that this requires a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. If you don't have one, feel free contact us directly.

- **Help out on Slack.** Participate in discussions on Slack to both help and learn from fellow users in topic related channels.
