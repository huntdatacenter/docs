      Hi HUNT Cloud team,

      I would like to request a new lab under our data space.

      I have attached a signed lab agreement to this email.

      We would like to start with the following machine type for our home machine:  

      ---
      lab_name="{lab_name}"  
      machine_type="{machine_type}"  
      ---

      We would like to attached the following storage volume sizes to our home machine (numbers are in Gigabytes):  

      ---
      ARCHIVE = {archive_volume} GB  
      WORK = {work_volume} GB  
      SCRATCH = {scratch_volume} GB  
      ---

      Our lab leader and lab coordinator will as quickly as possible forward individual user agreements for our initial users as separate requests using this link:

      https://docs.hdc.ntnu.no/service-desk/lab-orders.html#add-a-new-lab-user

      I am looking forward to receive an email verification stating that the lab is up and running.
