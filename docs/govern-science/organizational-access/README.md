## Background

We have five agreement layers in HUNT Cloud (illustration below). Two agreements at the organizational level needs to be in place before we can start onboarding your scientific centers, groups and projects.

## Agreements

### Data processor agreement

**The data processor agreement defines that your organization owns the data that you upload and generate in HUNT Cloud, and it specifies the privacy and security controls that are to be in place to protect your data.**

We use data processor agreement templates that is accepted by many organizations. These comply with requirements in GDPR, ISO 27001 and Norwegian health laws. Utilizing these templates is a quick way to ensure compliance with most requirements.

There is no direct cost for your organization associated with signing the data processor agreement with HUNT Cloud.

### Service center agreement

**The services agreement specify how cloud resources are provided and billed so you get a unified way to control your organizational activity in HUNT Cloud.**

The service center agreement simplify the process for your scientific centers, groups and projects to establish their own Data spaces and Labs in HUNT Cloud that remains under your control.

There is no direct cost for the organizational unit that sign the service center agreement, for example Departments at universities. However, all Data spaces and Labs under your organizational unit that are attached to this agreement will be invoiced for their resource consumption in accordance with specifications defined here.
