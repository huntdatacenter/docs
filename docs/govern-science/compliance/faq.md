## Audits

### Do you allow audits?

Yes. We encourage data controllers to audit our systems to ensure that they are implemented and operated as we state in our policies. Our Compliance administrator will coordinate the audit with your auditor team, and we will invite relevant team members for interviews in accordance on your audit scope. We are happy to arrange both physical and digital audits. [Contact us](/contact) for arrangements. 

### Do you allow third-party audits? 

Yes. Data controllers may hire external companies to conduct audits of our systems and services on their behalf. 

### Do you allow technical security tests? 

Yes. However, please note that you will need written approval of such testing *before* your start. [Contact us](/contact) for arrangements and agreements.

### Can we view your third-party audit results? 

Yes. Data controllers may [contact us](/contact) for copies of our yearly third-party [certification](/certificates) reports. 

### Can we view your internal audit results? 

Yes. Data controllers may [contact us](/contact) for status and results from our internal audit program. 

### Can we join an internal audit session? 

Yes. Representatives from our data controllers may join one or more of our internal audits for educational purposes. We provide this service to elevate and strengthen the audit expertise in your team. These sessions differ from an audit that you conduct in that it will be headed by our compliance officer and the audit program will be defined by us. You can choose if you would like to observe or join the auditor team alongside our compliance officer. On your request, we may arrange a pre-audit session where we discuss ISO standards, compliance criteria, common audit techniques, reporting and internal follow-ups. [Contact us](/contact) for arrangements.
