# Certificates

**HUNT Cloud complies with three international management systems, one for quality management (ISO 9001), one for information security (ISO 27001), and one for information privacy (ISO 27701).** 

For each certificate, independent auditors examines our governance, management, infrastructure, services and operations. Reports from these audits are available to data controllers on request.

Our ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 certificates have been issued since 2017, while our ISO 27701 certificate has been issued since 2024.

## Statement of Applicability (SoA)

Our Statement of Applicability, often referred to as "SoA", states which ISO control objectives we have applied in our ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 certificate. 

[Statement of Applicability for ISO 27001 and ISO 27701](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/certificates/hunt-cloud-soa-iso27001-and-iso27701.pdf) (PDF)

The SoA is a central document in our certification audits, and it guides Data controllers to quickly asses which controls they should expect to be in place to safeguard their data. 

To ease the readability, we have included the control's implementation status and comments where applicable.
