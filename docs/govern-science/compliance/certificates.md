## Scoping document

[Security and privacy scope](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/certificates/hunt-cloud-security-and-privacy-scope.pdf) (PDF)

This document describes the security and privacy scope of our information management system.

## Statement of Applicability (SoA)

[ISO 27001 Statement of Applicability](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/certificates/hunt-cloud-soa-iso27001.pdf) (PDF)

Our Statement of Applicability, often referred to as "SoA", states which ISO control objectives we have applied in our ISO 27001 certificate. 

SoA is a central document in our certification audits, and it guides Data controllers to quickly asses which controls they should expect to be in place to safeguard their data. 

In short, we state applicability for a total of 148 controls derived from [ISO 27002](https://www.iso.org/standard/54533.html) (general information security), [ISO 27017](https://www.iso.org/standard/43757.html) (cloud security), and [ISO 27701](https://www.iso.org/standard/71670.html) (privacy information management system).

To ease the readability, we have included the control's implementation status and a comment where applicable.
