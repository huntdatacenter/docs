# FAQ Tingweek

**This page lists frequently asked questions related to Tingweek.**




### Why Tings?

The inspiration to appoint time to meet at regular intervals in a layered structure is drawn from the Old Norse [ting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_(assembly)#Etymology) structures such as [Frostating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostating) here in Tr√∏ndelag. The intention is to ensure regular discussions on how we together best can elevate data for a better world, including feedback on how to best adapt and evolve the scientific toolbox of HUNT Cloud to better support your scientific journey.

### Is this an assembly?

No. Our tings are not the same as a general assembly (generalforsamling) with binding decisions. As of today, our tings are to be seen as a gathering of people that both champion and dream up ideas on how to best utilize data for a better world. HUNT Cloud is owned by NTNU which has the full financial and compliance responsibilities for our services.

### How do I get invited?

Ting invitations, agenda and digital meeting links are forwarded on email a few weeks before the Ting week. Dates will also be announced on these pages and on Slack.

### Where do we meet?

We will meet digitally at Zoom utilizing the NTNU subscription. Links will be forwarded on email and on Slack for the lab ting.

### Where are the minutes?

Our tings have public agendas and internal minutes. We write up a summary after the week that gets distributed directly to the invited parties. The summary contains statements from all tings.
