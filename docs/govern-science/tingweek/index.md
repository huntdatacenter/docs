# HUNT Cloud Tingweek

**We appoint time three times per year to meet for information, feedback and discussions on how to develop the services in HUNT Cloud to better elevate science. We call these gatherings Tings.**

We arrange a layered set of Tings for distinct groups in our community. The meetings are spread out over one week in the winter, spring and autumn. We call these weeks "Tingweeks".

## Tings

We have implemented a layered Ting structure to elevate voices and collective knowledge from distinct groups within the community. As of today, we appoint time for four different Tings that meet during the Tingweek:

This is our allting were we focuses on **user experience inside labs**, and communication between lab users and with us.

All active lab users, lab leaders and lab coordinators are invited for information, feedback and discussions on all aspects of existing, planned and future services.

### Data space ting

This is the Ting where we focuses on **cross-lab administration** in data spaces.

All data space administrators are invited for information, feedback and discussion on compliance, data, technologies, knowledge and financial administration.

### Data controller ting

This is the Ting where we initiate **cross-organizational dialogue on privacy, security and ethics** within HUNT Cloud.

All privacy, security and compliance administrators are invited.

### Lagtun

Lagtun is the Ting where we appoint time to evolve data-driven science and the scientific direction for HUNT Cloud through cross-organizational discussions among **data controllers, service centers and large data spaces** in the community.

Lagtun gives direct advice on our strategic and tactical development to the HUNT Cloud management in the form of resolutions.

## Reports

The intent of the Ting report is to give you the opportunity to read up on **what** we are doing at HUNT Cloud, and a little bit on **why** we do it. All so we can meet at the tings and have informed discussions on how to best elevate data for a better world!

We will not be able to make the reports for each Tingweek, although we will do our best to keep the list updated.
