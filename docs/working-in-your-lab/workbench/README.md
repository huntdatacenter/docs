# Workbench

**The intention with the Workbench is to give you a simple and secure place to explore your data and tools together with your team.**

## About

The Workbench is web-based and build around the feel of Jupyter notebooks with access to application such as _RStudio_, _R_, _Python_ and _Conda_. We have also included support for _MATLAB_ and _Stata_ for those than bring their own license.
