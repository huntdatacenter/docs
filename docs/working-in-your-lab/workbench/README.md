# Workbench

**The intention with the Workbench is to give you a simple and secure place to explore your data and tools together with your team.**

## About

The Workbench is web-based and build around the feel of Jupyter notebooks with access to application such as _RStudio_, _R_, _Python_ and _Conda_. We have also included support for _MATLAB_ and _Stata_ for those than bring their own license.

## Key transfer

Similar to your initial onboarding, we will send you a link to your certificate over your organizational email and your keys over Signal.

On your phone you should expect an image with your certificate key from phone number 91001893. This number is registered on NTNU. The text should include your **`TLS certificate`**.

On email you should expect a link to one (1) compressed file:

::: warning Expect these files on your local machine

A successful opening of the 7z-file file should include two (2) files:

- **`<labname>-<your-username>.p12`** - your TLS certificate.
- **`<labname>-<your-username>.mobileconfig`** - your OS X and MacOS configuration file.

When have successfully received your certificate, head over to our [Workbench installation page](/working-in-your-lab/workbench/installation/) to finalize your access.
