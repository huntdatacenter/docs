## Access

### I am unable to log in to my Workbench applications?

If you were previously able to access your applications in Workbench, for example RStudio, and then the access suddenly stopped, one quick approach to get things back up could be to restart your Workbench environment. [Click here](/working-in-your-lab/workbench/faq/#how-can-i-restart-my-workbench-environment-and-start-from-scratch) to learn how to restart. [Contact us](/contact) if you need further assistance.

### Has my certificate expired?

If you were previously able to access Workbench and now your browser reports expired certificates do not hesitate to [contact us](/contact), we can usually reissue new Workbench certificates pretty quickly.

## Experience

### Unresponsive workbench

An unresponsive or slow workbench may be caused by several things. Here's a small checklist to narrow down potential causes: 

* Use the Google Chrome as your browser as other browsers don't support all features and might cause potential silent failures.

* Restart your workbench environment to start fresh in the case something got hung up. [Click here](/working-in-your-lab/workbench/faq/#how-can-i-restart-my-workbench-environment) to se how.

* Check the resource consumption on your lab `home` machine to ensure that your have free memory and cpu resources for your tasks, for example by logging into yoru home machine and run [htop](/working-in-your-lab/technical-tools/htop/). Consider to upgrade your home machine size in the [service desk](/service-desk/lab-orders/#update-machine-size) if memory or cpu is full or near-full.

[Contact us](/contact) if none of these works for further investigation.
