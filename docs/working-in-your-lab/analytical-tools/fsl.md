# FSL

FSL is a comprehensive library of image analysis and statistical tools
for fMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data. The suite consists of various
command line tools, as well as simple GUIs for its core analysis pipelines.
Among others, FSL offers implementations of standard GLM analysis,
white matter tractography, tissue segmentation, affine and non-linear
co-registration, and independent component analysis [(Source: Neurodebian)](http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/fsl-complete.html).
