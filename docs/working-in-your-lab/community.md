# Cloud community

**All lab users and lab coordinators are invited to participate in our online cloud community. The intention is to enable scientists on all levels with a place to say hello to each other, ask for help when needed, and provide help to others when they can.**

## Slack as Digital café

We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) as our digital café. Conceptually, we see the various Slack channels as our digital café tables where we meet at different tables to discuss specific topics in an informal and relaxed atmosphere.

### Invitations

All lab users and lab coordinators are invited to Slack as part of their onboarding. [Contact us](/contact) if you are an active lab users or lab coordinator and need a new invitation.

### Tables

All labs gets their own private table (lab channel) where all lab users for that particular lab are invited. Here you can meet and discuss both scientific and technical topics, help each other out with issues and reach us at the HUNT Cloud for both questions and banter.

We have also reserved a set of community tables where you can meet users from other lab and discuss specific topics that is relevant for you. These channels are dynamic, and topics will vary over time with what's feels relevant within the community.

Missing a topic that's relevant for you? Do not worry. We are happy to add new tables. Reach us at your lab table and suggest the topic close to your heart.

### Tone of voice

We are truly proud of the warm and welcoming tone that our scientists brings to the cloud community. Needless to say when we meet from a wide range of scientific fields and heterogeneous backgrounds, all dialogue are to happen with **care and respect**.

You are free to utilize them all: (1) **text chat** at all tables, (2) **video calls** at your lab table (click on the member button in the upper right corner and choose "Start a Call"), and (3) **voice chat** and screen share at your lab table (click on the ear phone icon in the lower left part of your screen to start a "Huddle").
