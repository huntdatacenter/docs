## 2.1 Install the VPN software

[Download and install OpenVPN using the latest Windows Installer](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/)

Click on the link above, scroll down to the file named **`openvpn-install-<version-number>-i602-win10.exe`** (Windows 10 users), download the file and follow the on-screen installation instructions.

  ::: warning
  **You will need administrative rights on your local machine to successfully install OpenVPN.**

Click on the link below if you do not hold administrative rights on your local machine, or don't know if you have such rights.

  ::: details Installing OpenVPN without administrative rights

You can check if you have administrative rights on your local machine by running **`net localgroup "Administrators"`** in a [command prompt](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/) and see if your username is listed.

**Request assistance from your local IT personnel if you do not hold administrative rights on your local machine and request that they:**

(1) assist you in the OpenVPN installation, or

(2) grant you administrative rights on your local machine so you can install OpenVPN yourself.

For simplicity, we have outlined the steps they need to perform below which you can attach to your request.

```
1. Install the OpenVPN client on the computer for my user:
    Download and install using the Windows installer from https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html

2. Create an OpenVPN Administrators group on my computer:
    net localgroup /add "OpenVPN Administrators"

3. Add my user to OpenVPN Administrators group on my computer:
