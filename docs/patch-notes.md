<h3>Major changes</h3>

**Storage performance configuration**

We noticed substantial performance reduction on our  block storage configuration in Cloud2 as the usage increased over the summer.

After spending a significant amount of time identifying the root cause, we are now adding several measure to increase the system predictability.

As part of this, we have started to move current storage volumes over to new configurations. Labs will be contacted to schedule such updates with approximately one day downtime during implementation.

As a next step we plan to differentiate on different storage types/performance in our services specification and price list.

<h3>Minor changes</h3>

**Migration milestone**

More than half of all labs are now migrated from Cloud1 to Cloud2. After a small pause due to the storage performance issues, we have now resumed the migration. Remaining labs will be contacted to schedule their move to limit the downtime of scientific activities.

<h3>Minor changes</h3>

**VAT extemption outside NTNU**

We updated the [invoice profile form](/administer-science/agreements/downloads#invoice-profile) with a section on possible extemptions from value added tax. Documented collaborations with partners from NTNU may be exempted from VAT if delivery of trusted research environments is part of the collaboration agreement. [Contact us](/contact) is this is relevant for you.

**Automatic overhead estimates for temporary Internal kistas**

We are now automatically calculating file system overhead in internal kista orders. This means that you order a size that is equal to the amount of data that you plan to transfer. In short, kistas with a size below 1TB receives 100GB additional buffer size, and kistas above 1TB recieves 10 percent buffer to compensate for the file system.

**Restore option for new storage volumes**

We have added an option to select if you want restore to be anabled when you order new storage volumes. Previously such volumes was deployed without restore by default.

**External kista IPv4 validation**

Added a new field which will prompt user to validate their public IPv4 address. If IPv4 address is private, user will not be allowed to continue and should double check validity of their IPv4 address.


<h3>Upcoming features</h3>

**Spending limits**

We see a need to increase the spending limit intervals on invoice profiles from quarters to yearly amounts. The aim is to improve our reporting when you close in on the thresholds. We plan to reach out to invoice profile contacts before the 2024-Q2 invoice.

**Service descriptions**

We plan to introdue the new Services descriptions for Explore, Evolve and Scientific suite during the during the upcoming [Tingweek](/govern-science/tingweek/).

## About


#### Feedback

Found an issue, or want to submit a feedback? Send us a general request form in [Service Desk](/do-science/service-desk/#general-service-request).

#### Schedule

There are no fixed publication schedule for the next Patch note. The intention is to publish a new version whenever we think we have interesting updates to communicate. New notes gets communicated to our cloud community in Slack.


#### Numbering

We use a three digit numbering system on our Patch notes, for example version `2.8.3`.

| Number | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2 | Major services specification update |
| 8 | Minor services specification update |
| 3 | Patch notes number |

::: details Click here for details on the numbering

.

#### Major services agreement update

The first number indicates which major [Services specification](/administer-science/services/specifications) version the Patch notes are attached to.

The number references the first digit of the current Services specification version. For example, Services specification version `2.8` will be listed as `2`.

A major services agreement update indicates that services are changes in a way that need major agreement updates. Such updates are forwarded to all contractual partners on email, and major changes on existing services take effect 90 days after the announcement.

#### Minor services agreement update

The second number indicates which minor [Services specification](/administer-science/services/specifications) version the Patch note are attached to.

The number references the second digit of the current Services specification version. For example, Services specification version `2.8` will be listed as `8`.

A minor services agreement update indicate a change in the agreement text, such as clarifications, syntax updates and similar. These changes takes effect when they are communicated on these docs pages, and are not forwarded to contractual partners on email.

#### Patch notes number

The third number indicates which patch version the current note is attached to. Thus, a patch note is always linked to a specific Service specification version.

**Major updates**

Major updates indicates what we think are a substantial update in your user experience of our services.
Such improvements may not always need updates in legal documents.

**Minor updates**

Minor Patch notes indicates what we think are small (but often important) user experience updates of our services, for example updates of guides, agreements or other good-to-know-about things.

**Upcoming features**

These are features that we have planned to move forward by the time of the notes publication, although they are not always the features that we end up prioritizing over the next period.
