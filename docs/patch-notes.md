### <u>Major changes</u>

### Do science

#### *Workbench guides for SSH reset*

We are introducing the abillity for users to reset passphrase directly in Workbench.

* This method works for *new* and *existing* users. 
* Once you request SSH passphrase reset, head over to your Workbench to easily reset your passphrase in a familliar manner. 
* You can find further details in this [guide](/do-science/guides/configure-ssh-workbench/#ssh-passphrase-reset-in-workbench).


#### *Lab access link*

We are changing the way we approach onboarding of new users. This approach allows you to connect to our services using tailored-to-you copy-paste commands for your initial configuration.

* You can find Lab access link in your onboarding email, or request a new link in our Do science [service desk](/do-science/service-desk/#request-lab-access-reissue)


### Administer science

#### *Scientific access*

We are simplifying [Scientific access](/administer-science/scientific-access/) for new scientific centers and scientfic groups and have updated the initial onboarding process: 

* [New section](/administer-science/scientific-access/) that describes the scientific onboarding.
* [New scientific access bundle](/administer-science/scientific-access/#order-scientific-access) that combines information needed to add your first Data space and Lab. 
* [FAQ section](/administer-science/scientific-access/faq/) dedicated to scientific access.


### Govern science

#### *Organizational access*

We are simplifying [Organizational access](/govern-science/organizational-access/) and have updated the initial onboarding process:

* [New section](/govern-science/organizational-access/) that describes the organizational onboarding.
* [New organiztional agreement information form](/govern-science/organizational-access/#request-organizational-agreements) that combines information needed to generate your first data processor agreement and services center agreements. 
* [FAQ section](/govern-science/organizational-access/faq/) dedicated to organizational access.

#### Lagtun resolutions

The new [resolutions from Tingweek #9](/govern-science/tingweek/resolutions/) are adopted:

| 4 | Minor Patch notes | 

#### Major services agreement update 

The first number indicates which major [Services specification](/administer-science/services/specifications/) version the Patch notes are attached to. 

The number references the first digit of the current Services specification version. For example, Services specification version `2.8` will be listed as `2`. 

A major services agreement update indicates that services are changes in a way that need major agreement updates. Such updates are forwarded to all contractual partners on email, and major changes on existing services take effect 90 days after the announcement.
