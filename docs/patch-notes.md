### <u>Major changes</u>

### Do science

#### *Workbench guides for SSH reset*

We are introducing the abillity for users to reset passphrase directly in Workbench.

* This method works for *new* and *existing* users. 
* Once you request SSH passphrase reset, head over to your Workbench to easily reset your passphrase in a familliar manner. 
* You can find further details in this [guide](/do-science/guides/configure-ssh-workbench/#ssh-passphrase-reset-in-workbench).


#### *Lab access link*

We are changing the way we approach onboarding of new users. This approach allows you to connect to our services using tailored-to-you copy-paste commands for your initial configuration.

* You can find Lab access link in your onboarding email, or request a new link in our Do science [service desk](/do-science/service-desk/#request-lab-access-reissue)


### Administer science

#### *Scientific access*

We are simplifying [Scientific access](/administer-science/scientific-access/) for new scientific centers and scientfic groups and have updated the initial onboarding process: 

* [New section](/administer-science/scientific-access/) that describes the scientific onboarding.
* [New scientific access bundle](/administer-science/scientific-access/#order-scientific-access) that combines information needed to add your first Data space and Lab. 
* [FAQ section](/administer-science/scientific-access/faq/) dedicated to scientific access.


### Govern science

#### *Organizational access*

We are simplifying [Organizational access](/govern-science/organizational-access/) and have updated the initial onboarding process:

* [New section](/govern-science/organizational-access/) that describes the organizational onboarding.
* [New organiztional agreement information form](/govern-science/organizational-access/#request-organizational-agreements) that combines information needed to generate your first data processor agreement and services center agreements. 
* [FAQ section](/govern-science/organizational-access/faq/) dedicated to organizational access.

#### Lagtun resolutions

The new [resolutions from Tingweek #9](/govern-science/tingweek/resolutions/) are adopted:

* Enable reduction of inactive compute resources
* Clarify costs for migration to new systems
* Explore data provider initiated data deliveries 


### <u>Minor changes</u>

### Do science

#### *Azcopy guide*

* We added a quick guide for users who want to transfer files from Azure Storage to their lab. [Click here](/do-science/tools/transfer/azcopy) for details.

### Administer science

#### *Agreement updates* 

We updated the agreements for [External kista import order](/administer-science/agreements/downloads/#external-kista-import-order) (v2.1) and [External kista export order](/administer-science/agreements/downloads/#external-kista-export-order) (v1.4): 

* Naming of "Internal lab user" included in separate header to improve differentiation from lab leader.

### Govern science

#### New Tingweek dates

[Dates for upcoming Tingweeks](/govern-science/tingweek/dates/): Tingweek #10 (2023-10) and Tingweek #11 (2024-02) are published in the Tingweek section.
  
### Upcoming features

What are we working on ? 

* NVMe storage - faster storage type for GPU and CPU intensive workloads.
