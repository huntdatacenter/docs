* **Expected response time:** One week. The volume expansion will need a machine restart that needs to be scheduled.
* **Expected delivery:** Increased storage capacity.
* **Cost:** New storage is included in your total storage plan.

::: details Identify the required information

You may identify labname, machine name and volume name from your resource reports. Alternatively, you may log into your lab machine using SSH and fetch the information manually:


```bash
Welcome to `LAB NAME`.

For the record, if you shouldn't be here - please
leave and report the incident to cloud@hunt.ntnu.no.

Last login: Sun Dec  3 12:29:28 2017 from 10.10.10.10
your-username@`your-labname`-home~$
```

If you plan to expand volumes of machines other than `home`, log into your machine of choice to identify the exact name: 

```bash
# -- Example
`labname`-iaas-helya-gpu1
```

You can identify the volume name while you are logged into the machine: 

```bash
# -- Command
df -h | grep -E '(^Filesystem|/mnt/)'

# -- Output example
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vdc1       197G   61M  187G   1% /mnt/work
/dev/vdd1       493G   71M  467G   1% /mnt/archive

If you plan to add a volume on a machine other than `home`, log into your machine of choice to identify the exact name: 

```bash
# -- Example
`labname`-iaas-helya-gpu1

List the current volumes on the machine, and suggest a unique name for your new volume that is not already attached to your lab: 

```bash
