## FAQ on the new services model from 1. Januar 2022

### What if we would like to reduce our resources to reduce cost? 

Worry not. You may reduce resources in your lab until 1 April 2022 without cost. See [Resolution 4](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/tingweek/hunt-cloud-tingweek4-resolutions.pdf#page=3) for details, and feel free to [contact us](/contact) for dialogue on potential resource and cost optimization. 

### Remind us, when was the deadlines announced? 

The new service agreement and required agreement updates was first discussed during Ting #3 in May 2021 and announced on email and these pages 1. July 2021. The requirements was further discussed during Ting #4 in October 2021 and clarified in [Resolution 5](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/tingweek/hunt-cloud-tingweek4-resolutions.pdf#page=4) (R5/LT4/T4/21) from Lagtun. A warning on missing agreements was sent to all lab users in affected labs on email in the beginning of December.

### How do we terminate our lab? 

Yes, labs can be deleted (terminated) to avoid cost. Head over to our [service desk](/service-desk/data-space-orders.html) to request a deletion. Related to the 1. January deadline, labs can be terminated in two ways: (1) Labs that don't intend to resign agreements will automatically be terminated 1. January. Data will be made available for evacuation until 1. April (90 days) before the lab is deleted (ref. [Resolution 5(e)](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/tingweek/hunt-cloud-tingweek4-resolutions.pdf#page=4)). (2) Labs where you send us a signed [lab deletion order](/agreements/downloads/#lab-deletion-order) will be deleted as soon as practically possible. 

### How do we evacuate data from our lab before lab deletion? 

Lab deletion will irrevocably destroy all data in your lab. For a gracefully shut down we recommend that you first (1) [notify us on email](/contact) that you plan to delete your lab, next (2) order an [external export kista](/agreements/downloads/#external-kista-export-order) for data evacuation to your new location, and then (3) send us a signed [lab deletion order](/agreements/downloads/#lab-deletion-order) when you data is confirmed migrated to your new location. We will delete your lab as soon as possible after we receive the deletion order and return an written confirmation that your lab data is deleted in our systems.





## Compliance coordination

This section contains FAQ from compliance coordinators.




### Lab management

#### How can we add a new lab to our existing data space? 

In short, the compliance coordinator sends us a signed [lab order](/agreements/get-going/#lab-orders) and coordinate signed [user agreements](/agreements/downloads/#user-agreement) between your lab leader and your individual lab users. Head over to our [get going](/agreements/get-going/) for more information on the process.

#### How can we split one lab into two labs? 

As science grows inside your individual labs you may see the need to move part of this activity over to a new lab for example due to compliance issues separating data and lab users. Technically we don't split labs but add new ones. To add a new lab to your data space: 

- send us a new [lab order](/agreements/get-going/#lab-orders) and coordinate new new lab user agreements between your lab leader and individual lab users in the new lab;
- evaluate if you need to deactivate some users in your original lab after the move, and if so send us a list of users you want to deactivate on [email](/contact).
- consider how you will transfer data into your new lab, for example by ordering an [internal kista](/agreements/downloads/#external-kista-import-order) from your original to your new lab.

#### How can we move a lab to a different data space? 

We may transfer the ownership of a lab under your data space to another data space both inside or outside your organization. [Contact us](/contact) for such moves. We will need a lab transfer order that is co-signed by you and affected parties.

#### Can we rename an existing lab? 

No. Not at the moment. You can not rename an existing lab. However, you can register a new lab under your preferred name and migrate your data and activities over to this new name space.

#### Must our lab name be linked to a research project? 

No. You are free to choose your lab name independent of your scientific activities.

#### Can I choose a lab name that is similar to an already established lab? 

No. We would like our lab name spaces to be unique. This is both to help your lab branding and to ease our internal communication. Thus, we may from time to time ask you to think up a new name when you file your lab order if we already have another lab registered under the exact same name.

#### How can we delete one of our labs? 

Lab deletions are authorized by Data space leaders and documented in a [lab deletion order](/agreements/downloads/#lab-deletion-order) that is co-signed by both the data space leader and respective lab leader. All data and machines in the lab will be irrevocably destroyed in this process, and neither data nor machines can be recreated.

### Resources

#### If we add a new lab to our data space, how will this affect our resource consumption? 

Each new lab requires dedicated storage and compute resources since data and users are separated between the environments. Related to prices, you need to plan for one lab subscription, one lab machine and at least 1 terabyte storage for each lab. 

#### Can we share resources inside my data space? 

To a certain extent. Each lab has individual allocations of compute and storage resources to keep data and use segregated for privacy and security measures. 


#### Can we share resources inside one of our labs? 

Yes. Storage and compute resources are shared among all lab users inside the same lab. This means that all lab users can access all data and all compute resources inside the same lab.
