# Get going with your service center

**This guide aims to describe the steps to get you going as a service center in HUNT Cloud.**

[[toc]]

Service agreements defines a services center and regulates how services are provided, billed and controlled. Read more about the services agreement in our [agreement section](/agreements/overview/#services-agreement).


### 1. Decide where your services center should be located 

There is no direct cost associated with the establishment of a services center since invoices are sent directly to data spaces for services consumed in their lab. 

However, the services center is formally responsible for cost accumulated among their attached data spaces. Therefore, services agreements needs to be signed by a formal role in your organization, such as head of centers, departments, faculties, divisions or roles in your central management. 

::: tip NTNU

For NTNU, Services centers are located at the Department level with Deputy Head of Department for Research as the center leader.

We will send you the services final agreement by email as a PDF-file after we receive the required information:
