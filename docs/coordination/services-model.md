# New services model

**The new services model in HUNT Cloud was introduced 1st July, 2021. The aim is to simplify your path to complex cloud powers. The result is a new way to manage digital laboratories. The upgrade introduces changes for all users.**

::: tip Summary

* The service model introduces a new way to control and manage labs via "Services centers" and "Data spaces". This setup also includes a new way to price services in labs.  

* Our intention is to simplify access to labs and data spaces as soon as a service center is established, and to ensure predictable prices that allow for both access to flexible resources and sustainable services.  
 
* We will kindly ask all labs to sign a new set of agreements as soon as possible, and to help us organize your activities into data spaces and services centers. This needs to be completed before January 2022.  

* New labs will be required to use the new agreements from July 2021. Existing labs need to upgrade from October to adjust resources, and all labs need to upgrade before January 2022 to continue their services.

## About

Scientists deserve elegant and predictable services on their quest to change the world for the better! And they deserve solutions that bring people together for fun and impactful collaborations.

As our cloud community has been rapidly growing in both size and complexity, we saw a possibility to rethink our services model to keep up with the much appreciated growth. We are humble to now present the results.

We have put a lot of thinking and our best efforts into these changes with a clear intention to simplify access to great scientific services. We are thankful for all the in-depth discussions and feedback from the community.

The result is an upgraded services model that includes a new way to organize and manage digital laboratories (data spaces), a way to separate complex contractual aspects from scientific activities (services centers), and a new way to price scientific cloud services that we hope will give you both flexible access to resources and services that is sustainable over time. 


### New management model

We are introducing two new management units: Services centers and Data spaces. The intention of the new organization is to: (1) simplify onboarding of new labs, (2) simplify management of many labs under one research group, and (3) separate contractual services aspects from scientific activities. 
 
![Unit hierarchy](./services/images/hunt-cloud-service-units-overview.png "HUNT Cloud unit hierarchy")

**Services center** is a new cloud unit intended for the department level that regulates how cloud resources are controlled, priced and billed across data spaces and labs. This is controlled in a new [services agreement](/agreements/overview/#services-agreement) that includes the services specification and price list. Services centers are attached to data controllers.

**Data space** is a new cloud unit that is intended for the research center and research group level to simplify management of one to many labs, including cross-lab coordination, reporting and billing. Data spaces are now attached to a services center via a simple [data space order](/agreements/downloads/#data-space-order).

**Lab** is still the same thing: you collaborate, store and analyze your data inside a project. No changes, except that the registration of new labs are simplified into a quick to complete [lab order](/agreements/downloads/#lab-order).

To summarize, the separation of scientific aspects (data spaces and labs) from contractual complexity (data controller and services centers) allow for a simplified and quick way to boot up your data space and add new labs into your portfolio. The practical aspect is that we will need new agreements with all labs, and new agreements with data spaces and services centers. 












### New coordinator roles

One intention with data spaces is to simplify coordination and knowledge transfers between labs under the same research group or center. Based on discussions from our last two coordinator tings we are now introducing cross-lab coordinators for the following areas: 

![Coordinator roles](./services/images/hunt-cloud-data-space-roles.png "HUNT Cloud data space coordinator roles")

* The **compliance coordinator** is our point of contact for issues related to agreements and compliance evaluations such as DPIA and ethical approvals inside the data space. The compliance coordinator can place lab orders and acts as deputy for other contacts when needed, including for the data space leader.

* The **data coordinator** is the new point of contact for issues related to data inside the data space, including transfers, archiving, backups and similar for labs under the data space.

* The **services coordinator** is the new point of contact for issues related to cloud services and analytical tools, including configurations, adjustments and maintenance for labs under the data space.

* The **knowledge coordinator** is the new point of contact for knowledge transfers between lab users across labs under the data space, including know-hows related to user onboardings, common tasks, practical analytical setups, documentation etc.

A second goal of this setup is to enhance exchanges of scientific coordination expertise between data spaces within similar roles. We are already looking forward to [Ting week #4](/tingweek/) in October!












### New services model

We are introducing new [services specifications](/services/specifications/) with the intention to increase the predictability and to tune expectations of available services. The document is attached to the services agreement and includes the following service categories:

![HUNT Cloud services](./services/images/hunt-cloud-services.png "HUNT Cloud services")

The services specifications include three new [data space subscription levels](/services/overview/#data-space) named by colors. These differ in their individual service availability, resource prioritization, costs for individual resources etc. In short, 

![Data space subscription levels](./services/images/hunt-cloud-data-space-subscriptions.png "HUNT Cloud data space subscription levels")

* The **WHITE** data space subscription is intended to help small research groups into scientific cloud computing.

* The **ORANGE** data space subscription is intended to help medium sized research groups and small centers manage their portfolio of labs and benefit from volume discounts of storage.

* The **BLUE** data space subscription is intended to help large research groups and centers benefit from unified portfolio management, volume discounts on storage, cost-effective access to community resources (BLUE machines) and participation in our continuous development.








### New price model

Our passion is to elevate data for a better world. To do so, we have chosen to spend our time helping scientists with digital tools on their quest. Money is a means towards this goal, not an end. We are part of a public university that runs these services with zero profit. 

In that context, we have been thinking hard about how to best establish a model that takes into account the diverse needs of our community members. 

![Price bindings](./services/images/hunt-cloud-prices-bindings.png "HUNT Cloud price bindings")

Our solution is a model that tries to balance the need for financial financial predictability with scientific flexibility with three different prices: commitment prices, on-demand prices and BLUE prices. 

* **COMMITMENT** prices allow you to prepaid for services for one or three years. The intention is to allow for stability and predictable prices on services that you rely on.

* **ON-DEMAND** prices allow you to allocate resources that you pay for on a "per day" basis. The intention is to allow for flexibility in accordance with shifting needs in your research project.

* **BLUE** prices are reduced prices available on the BLUE data space subscription level. The intention is to allow for utilization of "common pool resources" and allow for low-cost flexibility.

For storage, we have a **VOLUME DISCOUNT** that is automatically calculated from all allocated terabytes across all labs attached to one data space. The intention is to encourage large data collections in your lab portfolio.

Details on how costs are measured (metered), adjusted and billed are included under each service chapter in our [services specifications](/services/specifications). 

::: tip PRICE LIST

Details on the cost for individual services are included in our price list.

:::

Three notes on the transition to new price model: 

* Services and resources that are allocated to established labs per 1 July 2021 will be given a pilot period until 1 January 2021 before the new prices will be metered and billed (see timeline below).

* New services or adjustments made after 1 July 2021 will be metered and billed from 1 October 2021 in accordance with the new model. 

* Prepayments made between 1 January 2020 and 1 July 2021 will be forwarded as Free Quota for the remaining of their project period.

We expect prices and services specifications to be adjusted three times per year based on discussions in our [ting weeks](/tingweek/).


### Continuous development

For the record, making a new model for how to organize digital laboratories and digital science is hard. We have given this our best shot in a direction that we think will elevate the scientific impact of our community. However, this is by no means perfect. The current model must be seen as work in progress under our continuous development principle. We have already allocated time in our next [ting week](/tingweek/) so we together can think up how to further improve the model and advance our common quest to elevate data for a better world! 


## Timeline

We will encourage all labs to migrate over to the new agreement model as soon as possible. All users will need to use the new services model from January 1, 2022, to continue your service. Under the "rule of no surprises", we will phase in the new model with the following key dates: 

![Month](./services/images/hunt-cloud-date-july-2021.png "Month")

* New services model announced.
* Onboardings of new organizations will from this date use the new agreement model. Prices for new organizations will be metered and billed from 1 October 2021.
* Current services and resources in existing labs per July 1 will be given a pilot period until 1 January 2022 before the new prices are metered and billed. 
* New services and resource adjustments in existing labs after July 1 will be metered and billed from 1 October 2022.

![Month](./services/images/hunt-cloud-date-october-2021.png "Month")

* Existing labs will need to migrate to the new agreement model for services adjustments and inclusion of new services.
* Services and resource adjustments in labs made after July 1 will be metered and billed.

![Month](./services/images/hunt-cloud-date-january-2022.png "Month")

* Services will be metered and billed in accordance with the new services model. 
* Lab labs needs to be migrated to the new agreement model to continue their services.























## Getting started

Well aware of [Tesler's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity) we know that this may feel complex. [Contact us](/contact) when you plan to bundle your labs into a data space so we can guide you in the process. 


### Upgrade agreements

You will need to migrate to the new agreement model, at the latest by 1 January 2021, and from 1 October 2021 to continue to adjust services and resources. Thus, it might be good to get going right away. 

Here are a list of the agreements that we need to update and the upgrade process: 

* **1. Check your data processor agreement status**: Depending on the agreement age, the new agreement model may require updates to the data processor agreement (before 2020). [Contact us](/contact) to check the agreement status for your organization. 

* **2. New services agreement**: Identify your desired services center level (typically departments), download the [cloud services agreement form](/agreements/overview/#required-information-2), add information to the text file and [return to us](/contact) for agreement rendering. The rendered agreement will need co-signature from your data controller and services center leader.

* **3. New data space order**: Download the new [data space order](/agreements/downloads/#data-space-order), complete the fields and [return to us](/contact) for registration. The new lab order requires co-signature from the services center leader. 

* **4. New lab order**: Download the new [lab order](/agreements/downloads/#lab-order) with the purpose of processing, complete the fields and [return to us](/contact) for registration. The new lab order requires co-signature from the data space leader. 





### Estimate cost

The prices are depending on several aspects, including data space subscription level, use of commitment and on-demand machines, your combined storage volume etc. [Contact us](/contact) for price estimates on your current lab activities and a discussion on how to optimize your resources to the new price list.
