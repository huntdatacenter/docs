# Conda, Anaconda, Miniconda and Bioconda

[Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) - [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) - [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) - [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io)

## Installation

### Install Conda

Follow the [Installing on Linux](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)
instructions to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers).

To get more out of conda we recommend reading
[Conda - Managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
guide.

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

After installation is done, log out and log in again to be able to use your conda setup.

### Set up Bioconda and Conda-forge channels

To find packages in Conda you need to configure relevant channels.
Follow the [Set up channels](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html#set-up-channels) guide from Bioconda.
We recommend starting with [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge). Quick way to make sure your channels are added correctly is to (re)add them in this order:

```
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

### Install your tools

Have a field day installing your favourite tools

```bash
conda install plink2
```

::: tip
We have very easy guide on how to get [Saige](/do-science/analytical/saige/) running in Conda environment.
:::

### Do cool science

```bash
plink2 <input>
```
