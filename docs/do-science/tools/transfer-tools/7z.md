```

If you do not want to install Homebrew or if you simply prefer an application with graphical interface, you can also give a try to [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).

## Extract an archive

::: tip WINDOWS

:::

```bash

```

or

```bash
7za e <myfile>.zip
```

## Compress small folders

This command allow you to compress and encrypt a folder:

```bash
7za a <filename-for-new-file.7z> <lab-folder> -p<key>
```

- **`<filename-for-new-file.7z>`** - Replace this with the name for you new compressed archive.
- **`<lab-folder>`** - Replace this with the path of the folder (or file) in your lab that will be compressed, for example **`/mnt/cargo/export-folder/`**.
- **`<key>`** - Replace this with the key (passphrase) that you will use to encrypt your archive and the receiever will use to decompress your archive. We recommend that your choose a [passphrase](/getting-started/configure-ssh/#_3-2-design-a-passphrase) of at least 12 characters.

::: warning Key transfer

Always transfer your key in a separate channel than your file. For example, you may consider to transfer files directly over SSH or filesender.no and keys over the encrypted mobile app Signal.

:::

## Compress large folders

For larger folders we recommend to split your compressed file into several parts for easier transfers. The code below split your folder into 100G chunks:

```bash
7za a -v100G <filename-for-new-file.7z> <lab-folder> -p<key>
```
