# FSL

FSL is a comprehensive library of image analysis and statistical tools
for fMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data. The suite consists of various
command line tools, as well as simple GUIs for its core analysis pipelines.
Among others, FSL offers implementations of standard GLM analysis,
white matter tractography, tissue segmentation, affine and non-linear
co-registration, and independent component analysis [(Source: Neurodebian)](http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/fsl-complete.html).

::: tip
Use [HTCondor](https://neuro.debian.net/blog/2012/2012-03-09_parallelize_fsl_with_condor.html)
with FSL to speed up analysis by running the tasks in parallel.

::: tip
[Bedpostx](https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~moisesf/Bedpostx_GPU/Installation.html) also supports
[GPU](/working-in-your-lab/technical-tools/gpu/), which provides significantly faster results on large datasets.

## Installation using Conda

Simple way for those who manage their dependencies with
[Conda](https://docs.hdc.ntnu.no/working-in-your-lab/analytical-tools/conda/)
is to install [FSLpy package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fslpy) into their
environment using this command:

```
conda install -c conda-forge fslpy
```

## Installation using flsinstaller

Our tutorial only briefly summarises the installation, therefore we recommend to read up
in official [FSL installation](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation/Linux).
