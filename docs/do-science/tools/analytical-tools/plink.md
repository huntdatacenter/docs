## How to install PLINK 2

Installing [PLINK 2](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/) is a little more cumbersome

You can either use [Conda](https://docs.hdc.ntnu.no/working-in-your-lab/analytical-tools/conda/)
to install [Plink2 package](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/plink2) or follow with binary release below.

To install package into your [Conda](https://docs.hdc.ntnu.no/working-in-your-lab/analytical-tools/conda/)
environment use this command:
```
conda install -c bioconda plink2
```

To download and unpack the binary for PLINK 2 follow these steps:

```bash
# Create a local binary directory in your home directory
mkdir ~/bin

# Download the latest binary of PLINK 2.
wget -P ~/bin/ http://s3.amazonaws.com/plink2-assets/plink2_linux_x86_64_latest.zip

# Install unzip
sudo apt install unzip

# Unzip the archive
unzip ~/bin/plink2_linux_x86_64_latest.zip -d ~/bin/

# Remove archive
rm ~/bin/plink2_linux_x86_64_latest.zip
```
