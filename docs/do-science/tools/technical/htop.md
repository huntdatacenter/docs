The above image shows a calm and low stress resource situation for a 8 CPU and 16 GB ram lab machine.

**CPU** The rows named 1 to 8 indicate the utilization of each CPU. The example shows utilization from 2.6 to 35.9 percentage, with a **`Load average`** (lower right quadrant) of 0.56.

**Memory**: The row named **`Mem`** shows that 5.04GB aout of 15.2 GB is used. This should allow for quick responses.

In low utilization cases, you may consider to downsize your lab machine.

### High utilization

![Htop high stress](./images/htop-stress-high.png)

The above image shows a situation where all CPUs are fully utilized. This is an optimal state if you are running large-scale anlaytics. However, for home machines with many users such utilization may cause laggy user experiences. 

In high utilization cases, you may limit your CPU and/or memory use to allow room for other users, run your processes with [lower priority](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/unice.htm), request a larger machine etc. Feel free to [contact us](/contact) for advice.
