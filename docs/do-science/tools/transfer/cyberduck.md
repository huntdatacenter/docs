3. Double-click on your new connection. You should successfully connect to your lab entry node.

## How to transfer your files

As of current state, you are unable to directly see all of your lab directories. For transfer of files, use your `cargo`directory for transfers. In cyberduck, you should see cargo folder under `/nfs/home/username`
