## Compress small folders

This command allows you to compress and encrypt a folder in your lab:

```bash
# -- principal examples
7za a <filename-for-new-file.7z> <lab-folder> -p<key>
```

- Replace `<filename-for-new-file.7z>` with the name for your to-be compressed archive.
- Replace `<lab-folder>` with the path of the folder (or file) in your lab that you aim to compress, for example **`/mnt/cargo/export-folder/`**.
- Replace `<key>` with a key (passphrase) that you generate. This key is used to encrypt your archive. We recommend that your choose a [passphrase](/do-science/lab-access/configure-ssh/#_3-2-design-a-passphrase) of at least 12 characters.

::: warning Secure key transfers

Transfer your key in a separate channel than your compressed file. For example, you may consider to transfer your compressed file over SSH or filesender.no, and to transfer your archive key over the encrypted mobile app Signal.

:::

## Compress large folders

For larger folders we recommend to split your compressed file into several parts for easier transfers. The code below split your folder into 100G chunks:

```bash
7za a -v100G <filename-for-new-file.7z> <lab-folder> -p<key>
```
