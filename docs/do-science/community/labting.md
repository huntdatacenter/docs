## You should participate! 

**Science never sleeps. And no service will ever be perfect.** 

Join the Labting to voice your hard earned expertise, and to help us to evolve the user experience in HUNT Cloud for both yourself and others.

We will cover a set of topics for each meeting that are related to your user experience, such as the HUNT Workbench, lab environments, service desk, web documentation, community, communication and similar.

**Most products and services that you use in HUNT Cloud have come together as a collaborative effort between members of the cloud community and our HUNT Cloud team, and may have been discussed and developed with input from our Labting.**

### All lab users will be invited

All active lab users, lab leaders and lab coordinators will get an invitation on the organizational email that you specified in your user agreement.

Participation in Labting is voluntary. Contact us in the [service desk](/do-science/service-desk/#general-service-request) if you want to reserve yourself from receiving future Ting invitations.

### Labting take place on Zoom

Labtings takes place on NTNU's Zoom subscription. Links are shared in the email invitation and will be shared on the `cloud-community` channel in Slack on the same days as the meeting. 

### Come and go as you like

**Our Labting is held on Tuesday between 2-4 pm CET during the Tingweek.** 

The first hour is reserved for a structured agenda, while the second hour is reserved for unstructured dialogue. 

You may choose to join and leave when you want. Some prefer to stay for fixed agenda, while others like to stay for the dialogue in the second hour.
