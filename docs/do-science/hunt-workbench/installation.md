# HUNT Workbench installation

**This guide will help you to connect to your HUNT Workbench over a web browser.**

[[toc]]


::: tip Check your onboarding email for Lab access link

We recommend that you follow the tailored guide in **Lab access link** for setting up **Workbench access** instead of this generic guide.

:::


## 1. Before you start

You will need the following to complete this guide:

::: warning Requirements

- A working VPN and SSH configuration as described in our [Getting started](/do-science/lab-access/) guide.
- A HUNT Workbench TLS certificate as described in the [HUNT Workbench certificate request](/do-science/guides/access-guides/workbench-request#_3-verify-your-certificate).

Without these it's impossible to complete this guide.

:::

::: tip Time

Allow for **30 minutes** to complete this installation and some playtime in your new environment.

:::

## 2. Edit your hosts file

First, let's set up your hosts file on your local computer. This allows you to connect to HUNT Workbench
in your lab using a URL name, for example **`demolab.lab.hdc.ntnu.no`**, in your web-browser.

Select steps for your operating system:

::: expander "Windows" id="2-windows"

1. Press the Windows key.

2. Type **`Notepad`** in the search field.

3. In the search results, **right-click** Notepad and select Run as administrator.

   ![notepad-administrator.png](./images/notepad-administrator.png)

   ![notepad-admin-confirm.png](./images/notepad-admin-confirm.png)

4. From Notepad, open the following file: **`C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`**.

   Start by selecting **`File`** > **`Open`**.

   ![notepad-open-file.png](./images/notepad-open-file.png)

   Then find the (1.) directory and change **`Text documents`** to view (2) **`All files`**. When a file named **`hosts`** appears in the list (3), select it and click **`Open`** (4):

   ![notepad-open-hosts-steps.png](./images/notepad-open-hosts-steps.png)

5. Add your **`hosts record`** to the text file. This is the line that you received from us in your HUNT Workbench onboarding email (look for Lab access link, the line is under point 6.9).

6. Select **`File`** > **`Save`** to save your changes and close the **`Notepad`** application.

:::



::: expander "OS X and macOS" id="2-osx-and-macos"

1. On your local computer, open your **`/etc/hosts`** file in your preferred text editor.

Example with text editor:

```
EDITOR='open -Wne' sudo -e /etc/hosts
```

Example with vim:

```
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

2. Add (append) the **`hosts record`** line that you received from us on email (look for Lab access link, the line is under point 6.2).

3. Close your text editor.

:::



::: expander "Ubuntu Linux" id="2-ubuntu-linux"

1. On your local computer, open your **`/etc/hosts`** file in your preferred text editor.

Example with gedit:

```
sudo gedit /etc/hosts
```

Example with vim:

```
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

2. Add (append) the **`hosts record`** line that you received from us on email (look for Lab access link, the line is under point 6.2).

3. Close your text editor.

## 3. Install your certificates

Let's install the certificates that is required to allow traffic with your HUNT Workbench that is located in your lab.

::: expander "Windows" id="3-windows"

<!-- Tested version: Windows 10 -->

1. Open your **`p12 certificate`** that you downloaded from FileSender (the file will be called `<username-labname>` for example **`user-demolab`**). Make sure the store location is set to **`Current User`** and click **`Next`**:

   ![1_cert_p12.png](./images/1_cert_p12.png)

2. Click **`Next`** one more time.

   ![2_cert_p12.png](./images/2_cert_p12.png)

3. Fill in the **`TLS passphrase`** that you received on signal, and make sure the options are checked exactly as in the image. Then click **`Next`**:

   ![3_cert_p12.png](./images/3_cert_p12.png)

4. Check the first option: _Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate_. Click **`Next`**:

   ![4_cert_p12.png](./images/4_cert_p12.png)

5. You should now get a _Completing the Certificate Import Wizard_ message. Click **`Finish`** to complete the import:

   ![5_cert_p12.png](./images/5_cert_p12.png)

6. The wizard will require a confirmation to install a certification from us: **`HCTS CA 1`** (_HUNT Cloud Trust Services_). Our certificate is required to safely access your workbench environment.

   You will normally be asked to confirm our certificate only when you set up the HUNT Workbench for the first time. Thus, if you see **`LAB`** instead of **`HCTS CA 1`** skip to step 7.

   Before clicking **`YES`**, confirm that you see our thumbprint (fingerprint):

   ```
   ADD9DFEC C998BE44 AC2F254E 75E5EB98 D91879A6
   ```

   ![6_confirmCAcertificate.png](./images/6_confirmCAcertificate.png)

7. Similar to Step 6, you will also need to install a certificate for your lab (**`Lab CA`**), where your Lab name should appear. Click **`YES`**.

   ![7_confirmLabCAcertificate.png](./images/7_confirmLabCAcertificate.png)

8. Now quit your browser and restart it for the certificate to get recognized.

   ![8_import_success.png](./images/8_import_success.png)

::: expander "macOS Ventura 13+" id="3-macos"

1. Open your system profile config file that you got from FileSender (**`<your_user_name>.mobileconfig`**).

2. In **`System settings`** open section **`Privacy & Security`**, scroll to the bottom of the page and select **`Profiles`**

   ![macventura1](./images/macventura1.png)

3. Select certificate required for installation.

   ![macventura2](./images/macventura2.png)


4. Click **`Install`**  when prompted. Then enter the **`TLS passphrase`** that you received on Signal and confirm.

   ![macventura3](./images/macventura3.png)

5. Quit your browser and restart it again for the certificate to get recognized.

6. When you open your HUNT Workbench for the first time you will be asked for your local macOS password. This allows the browser to access your client certificate stored in your local Keychain. After filling in the password, confirm by clicking **`Always allow`** / **`Tillat alltid`**.

   ![macos_chrome.png](./images/macos_chrome.png)


:::

::: expander "macOS Monterey and older" id="3-macos-monterey-and-older"

<!-- Tested version: MacOS Monterey -->

1. Open your system profile config file that you got from FileSender (**`<your_user_name>.mobileconfig`**).

2. In **`System Preferences`** open section **`Profiles`**.

   ::: warning NTNU managed MacBook

   If your MacBook is managed by NTNU and you do not see section Profiles in your System Preferences you will need to request access to Profile through NTNU Hjelp. If you are not NTNU affiliated, can contact your IT department for assistance.

3. Click **`Continue`** to confirm your profile installation.

   ![macos-profiles-continue.png](./images/macos-profiles-continue.png)

4. Enter the **`TLS passphrase`** that you received on Signal and the click **`Install`** to confirm.

   ![macos-profiles-credentials.png](./images/macos-profiles-credentials.png)

5. Quit your browser and restart it again for the certificate to get recognized.

6. When you open your HUNT Workbench for the first time you will be asked for your local macOS password. This allows the browser to access your client certificate stored in your local Keychain. After filling in the password, confirm by clicking **`Always allow`** / **`Tillat alltid`**.

   ![macos_chrome.png](./images/macos_chrome.png)

:::

::: expander "Ubuntu Linux" id="3-ubuntu-linux"

<!-- Tested version: Ubuntu 22.04 -->

```bash
# -- Principal example
https://<labname>.lab.hdc.ntnu.no

# -- Demo example
https://demolab.lab.hdc.ntnu.no
```

You may get a **`User Identification Request`** for your new certificate. Verify that the certificates are issued by:
(Click Certificate information > Details and look for names given under)

```bash
Organization: "HUNT Cloud"
Issued Under: "HUNT Cloud Trust Services"
```

If given the option, ensure that the **`Remember this decision`** box is checked, and click **`OK`**.
