# Data

<!-- 

- Where to find your data

 -->

HUNT Workbench uses the same storages volumes as your home machine. This means that you can access all lab data, including your **`home`**-directory, using the same paths in your scripts, for example:

```bash
/mnt/archive/<my-data-folder>
```

Your Jupyter Notebooks and code files are stored in the following shared **`work`**-volume on your home machine:

```bash
/mnt/work/workbench/${USER}
```
