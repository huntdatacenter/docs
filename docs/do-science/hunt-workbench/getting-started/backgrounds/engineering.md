# Engineering

Do you have engineering background? Reach out on slack if you would like to build extensions for Workbench.
One such example would be integrating existing web based tools into Workbench.
We have many examples of existing extensions that are currently in use.

## Solara

## Proxy extensions

To integrate existing web applications into Workbench we recommend using [jupyter-server-proxy](https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Feel free to have a look on the examples in our [Github repositories](https://github.com/huntdatacenter/?q=proxy&type=all&language=&sort=).
