## Reproducible science

Conda is a great way to help you take control over your dependencies, and to avoid unwanted surprises over time. We recommend you to start with their guide on how to [manage environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).



## A safe place to experiment

Create your own environments for Python or R packages. Export the details into the environment file for reproducibility. Share environment files with others.

## Conda or Mamba

We install both. Generally they should be interchangeable. Use mamba instead of conda for create and install commands for quicker setup.

## Create a sharable environment
