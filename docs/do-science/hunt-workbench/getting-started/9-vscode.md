1. Creating Jupyter nootebook in VS Code
2. How to select python kernel from same conda installation as is used by Jupyterlab (use example kernel that we install on user setup: py310)
3. How to run code in cells
3. To explain how to create environment - Refer to python section in this getting-started guide where that is already written up
4. Try and add a section on R if possible to run R code with R kernel (e.g. if selecting r-base environment)

# Visual Studio Code

### Creating Jupyter Notebook in VS Code
To create a Jupyter notebook in Visual Studio Code:
- Open VS Code via button found in your Workbench (It might load for a few minutes when you open the first time)
- Click on the "View" menu, you will find it by clicking the button that show three lines on the left side of the screen, then press "Command Palette".
- Type "Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook" and hit Enter.
- A new untitled notebook will be created where you can start writing your code.

### Creating Python Conda environment
To create a basic python Conda environment, follow this [link](/do-science/hunt-workbench/getting-started/4-python) for further instructions. 

### Selecting Python Kernel from Conda Installation
To select a Python kernel from the same Conda installation as used by JupyterLab:
- Open the notebook you created.
- At the top right corner, click on the kernel dropdown menu.
- Choose the kernel corresponding to the Conda environment you want to use (e.g., `py310`).

### Running Code in Cells
To run code in cells:
- Simply click on the cell you want to run.
- Press `Shift+Enter`, or click the "Run" button in the cell toolbar.
- The code in the cell will execute, and the output (if any) will be displayed below the cell.


### Running R Code with R Kernel
To run R code with an R kernel. Basic R env is offered as default in your Workbench. For more detailed setup, follow this [link](/do-science/hunt-workbench/getting-started/5-rstudio#how-to-create-r-environment)
- Open a new or existing notebook.
- Choose the R kernel from the kernel dropdown menu.
- You can now write and execute R code in the notebook.
