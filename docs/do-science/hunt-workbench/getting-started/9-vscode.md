in progress...

TODO

1. Creating Jupyter nootebook in VS Code
2. How to select python kernel from same conda installation as is used by Jupyterlab (use example kernel that we install on user setup: py310)
3. How to run code in cells
3. To explain how to create environment - Refer to python section in this getting-started guide where that is already written up
4. Try and add a section on R if possible to run R code with R kernel (e.g. if selecting r-base environment)
