# Stata

<!-- 

- how does it work with Stata license
- why we only do stata in Jupyter notebooks
- point at official websites recommending pystata
- stata examples

-->

Running Stata in Workbench requires a license. In most cases such license is already provided by your institution and you can request it from your IT.

We are part of NTNU which means that NTNU employees do not have to bring in the license. You can just request Stata in Workbench. Send request through [general service request](/do-science/service-desk/#tingweek:~:text=data%20space%20subscription.-,%23,-General%20service%20request)

## Limitations

You can only run Stata in [workbench terminal](/do-science/hunt-workbench/faq#terminal) or as unofficial [Jupyter Kernel](https://kylebarron.dev/stata_kernel/).

You can also call Stata commands from python using an official solution [pystata](https://www.stata.com/python/pystata18/).

## Examples

Check out an example notebook to see how Stata can be used in Jupyter notebooks - [Example stata_kernel Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/kylebarron/stata_kernel/blob/master/examples/Example.ipynb).
