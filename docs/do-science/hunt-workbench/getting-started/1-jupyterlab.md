# JupyterLab

> [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

We recommend official JupyterLab guides to get familiar with the interface:
- [The JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/interface.html)
- [Working with Files](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/files.html)
- [Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/notebook.html)

> Jupyter notebooks are documents that combine live runnable code with narrative text (Markdown), equations (LaTeX), images, interactive visualizations and other rich output.
