# MATLAB

To be able to run MATLAB in Workbench you need to bring your own license. In most cases such license is already provided by your institution and you can request it from your IT.

We are part of NTNU which means that NTNU employees do not have to bring in the license. You can just request MATLAB in Workbench.

MATLAB installation in Workbench comes also with MATLAB kernel, you can read about both in https://blogs.mathworks.com/matlab/2023/01/30/official-mathworks-matlab-kernel-for-jupyter-released/
