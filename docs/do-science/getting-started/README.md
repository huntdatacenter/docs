# Introduction

**This guide will help you to connect and get started on your HUNT Cloud lab after your lab has requested access in our administer science [service desk](/administer-science/service-desk/lab-orders).**

[Install Signal](/do-science/getting-started/collect-your-keys/#_1-1-secrets-to-your-phone) as soon as your lab has sent us your signed user agreement. This allows us to quickly forward you the lab keys when they are ready.

The following steps will help you to invest time in your lab setup, all so you can enjoy simple and secure access for all your future connections:
