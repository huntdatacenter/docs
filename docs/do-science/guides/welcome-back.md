# Welcome back
Science has natural cycles and seasons for courses, writing grants, publishing and supervising students. The human has it's seasons too, with time for breaks, work sprints, parental leave or caring for family members. 
Picking up the thread is probably one of the most important skills you can learn. 

We fully understand and support that you don't use your digital lab every day, and that sometimes you need to do something else for a while.
This is for you who are ready to come back.

### First thing first, are you able to log in at all?

### No I'm not able to get in
Users who have been inactive for more than 180 days are automatically deactivated. We do that to make sure that people who have left are taken off a lab, even if the lab leader forgets to inform us.

If your user is deactivated, your lab leader or coordinator need to request reactivation of your user through this link:
[User reactivation](/administer-science/service-desk/lab-orders/#reactivate-lab-user)

Both you and either the lab leader or coordinator will need to sign the new user agreement. Contact us on slack or [email](/about/contact/) if you don't know who your lab leader or coordinator is.

### My user is active but I forgot everything

If you can't remember the link to access your lab, you order a new link here: 
[Lab access link](/do-science/service-desk/#request-lab-access-link-reissue)

On our documentations pages there are no buttons named "I forgot my password".
Rather, you need to do one of two things (or both):

**Reset your SSH passphrase**
This is essentially resetting your password. 
SSH is a secure way to access a server and since the passphrases also expire, you need to create a new one. 
To to do that, order a reset here: [SSH passphrase reset](/do-science/service-desk/#lab-access)

**Get a new certificate for your Workbench**
This only means that your access expired, nothing changed or was removed from your Workbench.
You order a new certificate here: [Workbench certificate](/do-science/service-desk/#lab-access)

### Organisation at a glance
Your lab is hosted on a server located in our data rooms. Inside the lab, you have your own Workbench where you have your folders, data and tools. Your Workbench is automatically set up with the folders Work, Archive and Scratch. We recommend that people use Archive to store their data and Scratch for temporary files. Work is where you do your actual work. 

We continously improve our services, so Workbench might look a bit different from the last time you saw it. 
Rest assured that we never move or interfere with the "inside" of you digital lab (i.e. your data and files) without your consent and clear communication first.

If you are unsure about what is going on in the lab, grab a coffee with your lab mates or lab coordinator. 

### What happened since last time
We continously update our services. Workbench, the documentation pages and other parts of the service might look different when you return after after a while.
Take a look at our [patch notes](/administer-science/patch-notes/#patch-notes) to get a glimpse of the last updates. 

### Where can get more information?
Our documentation pages can help you get started with HUNT Cloud again. Take a look at our [Do science](/do-science) pages and our [FAQs](/do-science/faq)

### Where can I get help?
We are always happy to get in touch and hear what is going on. The best way to reach us is through our [Service desk](/do-science/service-desk/#service-desk-for-lab-users) and Slack.

We have Service Desk for the most common orders, but if none of these fit, you can reach us in your lab channel on Slack or place a general request [here](/do-science/service-desk/#general-service-request)

### Be generously impatient
It's  normal to not remember where you left off and to feel both frustrated and overwhelmed as you start picking up the threads. But give yourself enough patience to figure it out. 

Spend a little time clicking around and get to know your digital lab again, getting reaquinted with your data, scripts and thinking.

If you feel that your past self was a messy idiot, that is fine too - we have all been there. Approach your mess with the same curiousity as you would any scientific problem and carefully untagle each knot. 
 Reach out to us and your lab coordinator if you get lost.
