2. Successful setup of [Google authenticator](/do-science/lab-access/1-collect-keys#_1-3-one-time-verification-codes) app. 


## 2.1 Install the VPN software



::: details Windows

We use the open-source application **`OpenVPN`** to ensure encrypted communication between your local computer and us.

[Download and install OpenVPN using the latest stable Windows Installer (Avoid beta versions)](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/)

Click on the link above, scroll down to the file named **`OpenVPN-<version-number>-i601-amd64.msi`** (Windows 10 users), download the file and follow the on-screen installation instructions.

**NTNU users**: Windows users from NTNU can install OpenVPN community edition using NTNU Software Center even without administrative rights.
  
  ::: warning
  **You will need administrative rights on your local computer to successfully install OpenVPN.**

Click on the link below if you do not hold administrative rights on your local computer, or don't know if you have such rights.

  ::: details Installing OpenVPN without administrative rights

You can check if you have administrative rights on your local computer by running **`net localgroup "Administrators"`** in a [command prompt](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/) and see if your username is listed.

**Request assistance from your local IT personnel if you do not hold administrative rights on your local computer and request that they:**

(1) assist you in the OpenVPN installation, or

(2) grant you administrative rights on your local computer so you can install OpenVPN yourself.

<b>For simplicity, we have outlined the steps they need to perform, which you can attach to your request:</b>

## Immediate troubleshooting

Below are a few immediate things to try if your VPN connection did not succeed:

### Authenticate VPN

If the _Authenticate VPN_ prompt pops up again, then try to log in again with a new **`verification code`**.

### VPN connection failed

If you received the notification _VPN Connection Failed_ after 60 seconds, please check the following

- Verify that you have an active internet connection.
- Verify that the _Private Key Password_ is correct.

### Could not read Private Key error

The error messages below indicates that there is a typo in the _Private Key Password_ (step 2.3.5) and you need to type it in again.

```
ERROR: could not read Private Key username/password/ok/string from management interface
```

```
Cannot load private key file
```

### Unable to apply changes

If you are unable to click _Apply_ after your changes, try to re-enter your _Private Key Password_ using your **`VPN passphrase`** that you collected in Step 1.
