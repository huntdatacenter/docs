# VPN certificate reset

**This guide describes how to reset your VPN certificate and passphrase required to access your lab when you receive your shipments from the [VPN certificate reset](/do-science/service-desk/#vpn-certificate-reset) order.**

[[toc]]

## 1. Requirements

::: warning Shipments from the VPN certificate reset order 

1.1 Your new VPN certificate and VPN profile in a compressed `7z`-file sent over filesender.no

1.2. Your new `VPN passphrase` and your `7-ZIP file key` sent over Signal.

:::

**Required software**. The following required software should already be installed during your initial onboarding: 

1.3. Working VPN software (if not, head over to our Getting started guide to [install the VPN software](/do-science/lab/#_2-1-install-the-vpn-software).

1.4. A working Google authenticator application on your phone that provide time-based VPN verification codes (if not, you can order a [Google authenticator key reset](/do-science/service-desk/#google-authenticator-key-reset) in our service desk).

## 2. Download and unpack your new certificate

We will communicate your VPN certificate over your organizational email. You will receive a link to an encrypted file archive (7z-file).

::: expander "Windows" id="2-windows"

2.1 Click on the link in the email to download the file and save this on your local computer.

2.2 Unpack (extract) the file using [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

alternatively, you can install keka using brew command below

```bash
brew install keka
```

2.3 Use the key named **`7-ZIP file key`** from your Signal transfer to decrypt the archive folder.

If you successfully completed this step, head over to Step 3 to [Configure your SSH](/do-science/lab/) connection. If you did not succeed, start with a quick look in our Immediate troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting

Below are a few immediate things to try if your VPN connection did not succeed:

### Authenticate VPN

If the _Authenticate VPN_ prompt pops up again, then try to log in again with a new **`verification code`**.

### VPN connection failed

If you received the notification _VPN Connection Failed_ after 60 seconds, please check the following

- Verify that you have an active internet connection.
- Verify that the _Private Key Password_ is correct.

### Could not read Private Key error

The error messages below indicates that there is a typo in the _Private Key Password_ (step 2.3.5) and you need to type it in again.

```
ERROR: could not read Private Key username/password/ok/string from management interface
```

```
Cannot load private key file
```

### Unable to apply changes

If you are unable to click _Apply_ after your changes, try to re-enter your _Private Key Password_ using your **`VPN passphrase`** that you collected in Step 1.
