# Access from new computer

We are happy to hear that! If you have a new local computer you will need to request new certificates.

## Required

You will need new VPN certificate and new workbench certificate.

<SDButton form="request_vpn_reset" />

<SDButton form="request_workbench_reissue" />

## For consideration

If you don't remember your passphrase, you may request a reset

::: tip
If you order SSH passphrase reset, MobaXterm and SSH configuration steps will be included.

:::

<SDButton form="request_ssh_pass_reset" />

If you remember your password, but do not remember your lab IP or Mobaxterm configuration, you may consider to request a lab access link again.

<SDButton form="request_lab_access_link" />
