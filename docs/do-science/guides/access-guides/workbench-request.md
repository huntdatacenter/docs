::: tip

[Click here](/do-science/hunt-workbench/installation) for the main HUNT Workbench installation guide.

:::

## 1. Request access

If you have not received the certificate as part of your onboarding you can request access to your HUNT Workbench in our [do science service desk](/do-science/service-desk/#hunt-workbench-access).

## 2. Prepare Signal

After you have sent us your HUNT Workbench access request, ensure that you have installed and activated the **Signal app** on your phone so we can quickly forward your certificate when they are ready.

## 3. Verify your certificate

Similar to your initial onboarding, we will send you (1) your keys over Signal to your phone and (2) a link to your certificate to your organizational email.

1. On your phone you should expect an image with your certificate passphrases from phone number **`+47 91001893`**. This number is registered at NTNU. The text should include your **`TLS certificate`**.

2. On email you should expect a link to one (1) compressed file:

::: warning Expect these files on your local computer

A successful opening of the 7z-file file should include two (2) files related to HUNT Workbench setup:

* `<labname>-<your-username>.p12` - your TLS certificate.
* `<labname>-<your-username>.mobileconfig` - your OS X and MacOS configuration file.

## 4. Start your installation

When you have successfully received your certificate, head over to our main [HUNT Workbench installation guide](/do-science/hunt-workbench/installation) to finalize your setup.
