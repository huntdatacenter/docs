# SSH passphrase reset

**This guide describes how to reset your SSH passphrase on your entry and home machines.**

::: tip Need a passphrase reset? 

Order a SSH passphrase reset in our do-science [service desk](/do-science/service-desk/#ssh-passphrase-reset).

## 1. Requirements

A running VPN connection to HUNT Cloud as described in our [Configure your VPN](/do-science/lab/) guide.


## 2. Design a passphrase

You will need to update your **`SSH temporary key`** in the steps below. We prefer that you design a **`passphrase`** instead of a password. A passphrase is a series of words that creates a phrase. It should be:

- long enough to be hard to guess
- not a famous quotation from the literature (but could be pretty close)
- hard to guess by intuition (even by someone who knows you well)
- easy to remember

Oh, and, it should be unique to this site only (not to mention at least
_12 characters_ long and include both _lower_ and _upper_ cases).

Making a good passphrase is great fun and good security hygiene. Here's one to get you going:

```bash
AnalysingPokemon4FunInTheMorning
```

::: warning Expected outcome

A unique **`passphrase`** of minimum 12 characters containing both lower and upper cases.

## 3. Change passphrase for your Entry machine

::: details Windows

1. Download and save the **`Putty`** SSH client from [this link](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe), or follow with the next step if you already have **`Putty`** installed.

2. Click on the **`putty.exe`** file that you downloaded to your local computer and start the client.

3. Make sure "_Host Name (or IP address)_" field contains: **`<your-username>@<your-lab-IP>`** and click "_Open_".

4. Enter your **`SSH temporary key`** in the terminal window that appear when asked for a password and hit enter. You will not see anything on the screen when you type your password.

5. Type the same **`SSH temporary key`** _one more time_ when asked and hit enter.

6. Enter your new **`passphrase`** from above and hit enter.

7. Retype your **`passphrase`** for verification and hit enter. You will now be kicked out of the entry machine connection.

8. Repeat Step 2 and 3 to verify your passphrase update. Type your **`passphrase`** when asked for a password. You should now be logged into your entry machine.

:::

::: details OS X and macOS

1. Start **`Terminal`** (Command + Space, type "Terminal").

2. Type **`ssh <your-username>@<your-lab-IP>`**

3. You should then be prompted to enter a password **`<your-username>@<your-lab-IP>'s password:`**

4. Enter your **`SSH temporary key`** collected in Step 1 _two_ times.

5. Enter your new **`passphrase`** and retype for verification. You will be kicked off the entry machine by completion.

6. Repeat step 2. and 3. to verify your passphrase update. Type your **`passphrase`** when asked for a password. You should now be logged into your entry machine.

:::

::: details Ubuntu Linux

1. Start **`Gnome Terminal`** (Ctrl + Alt + T).

2. Type **`ssh <your-username>@<your-lab-IP>`**

3. You should then be prompted to enter a password **`<your-username>@<your-lab-IP>'s password:`**

4. Enter your **`SSH temporary key`** collected in Step 1 _two_ times.

5. Enter your new **`passphrase`** and retype for verification. You will be kicked off the entry machine by completion.

6. Repeat step 2. and 3. to verify your passphrase update. Type your **`passphrase`** when asked for a password. You should now be logged into your entry machine.

::: warning Expected result

By completion your should be logged into your **entry machine** and see a terminal window that looks about the same as the example below.
It should mention **-entry** to be sure you are connected to correct machine:

2. You will be prompted to type your **`SSH temporary key`** _one time_.

3. Similar to above, you will be asked for a new passphrase. Type your **`passphrase`** _two times_.

4. Similar to above, you will be kicked out of your home machine and back to your entry machine by completion.

5. Similar to above, verify a successful passphrase update by logging into your home machine typing **`ssh home`** once more.
