### Transfers with partners outside HUNT Cloud

[External kistas](/do-science/transfers/external-kista/) ensures controlled transfers between external parties outside HUNT Cloud and labs inside HUNT Cloud.

### General transfer resources

The [Data transfer tools section](/do-science/tools/transfer/) covers commonly used tools for transfers.

See our Frequently asked questions on [internal](/do-science/faq/internal-transfer/) and [external](/do-science/faq/external-transfer/) transfers.
