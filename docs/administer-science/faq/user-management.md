## New users

### How do we add new users?

Lab leaders and lab coordinators may order access for new lab users in our [servie desk](/service-desk/lab-orders/#add-a-new-lab-user). New users must sign the user agreements. Next, head over to our [onboarding guide](/getting-started) to prepare your key shipment.

### How long does an account activation take?

Allow for one week. However, we do recognize that science never sleeps, so [contact us](/contact) for high priority activations same or next business day when strictly needed.

### How many users can we add to a lab?

We have no hard limits. When that is said, all users in your lab will have access to all the data in the lab. Thus, we require that you limit users to those that have permissions in place to work with your data. Usually, labs with up to 6-7 people seem to be most effective. We are more than happy to spin off new labs as your team grows.

### Can we add users from outside our own organization?

Yes. Part of the rationale for our services is to keep data close to its donors by bringing scientists to the data. The data processor of your data (usually the host organization of the lab leader) is formally responsible for adding new users. We are happy to activate accounts for users that lab leader authorizes, both from local, national and global institutions. Keep in mind that users in your lab will have access to all of your lab data.
