# Coordinator FAQ

**This section lists common questions related to the scientific coordination in your data space and across your labs.**

This page is intended for data space coordinators. Head over to our [Lab FAQ](/faq/) for questions related to scientific activities inside labs.

## Compliance coordination

This section contains FAQ from compliance coordinators.




### Lab management

#### How can we add a new lab to our existing data space? 

In short, the compliance coordinator sends us a signed lab order and coordinate signed user agreements between your lab leader and your individual lab users. Head over to our [get going](/coordination/get-going/lab)-pages for more information on the process.

#### How can we split one lab into two labs? 

As science grows inside your individual labs you may see the need to move part of this activity over to a new lab for example due to compliance issues separating data and lab users. Technically we don't split labs but add new ones. To add a new lab to your data space: 

- send us a [new lab order](/service-desk/data-space-orders.html#new-lab) and coordinate new lab user agreements between your lab leader and individual lab users in the new lab;
- evaluate if you need to deactivate some users in your original lab after the move, and [request user deactivation](/service-desk/lab-orders.html#deactivate-lab-user) in your original lab if relevant.
- consider how you will transfer data into your new lab, for example by ordering an [internal kista](/agreements/downloads/#external-kista-import-order) from your original to your new lab.

#### How can we move a lab to a different data space? 

We may transfer the ownership of a lab under your data space to another data space both inside or outside your organization. [Contact us](/contact) on email for such moves. We will need a lab transfer order that is co-signed by all affected parties.

#### Can we rename an existing lab? 

No. Not at the moment. You can not rename an existing lab. However, you can register a new lab under your preferred name and migrate your data and activities over to this new name space.

#### Must our lab name be linked to a research project? 

No. You are free to choose your lab name independent of your scientific activities.

#### Can I choose a lab name that is similar to an already established lab? 

No. We would like our lab name spaces to be unique. This is both to help your lab branding and to ease our internal communication. Thus, we may from time to time ask you to think up a new name when you file your lab order if we already have another lab registered under the exact same name.

#### How can we delete one of our labs? 

Lab deletions are authorized by Data space leaders and documented in a [lab deletion order](/agreements/downloads/#lab-deletion-order) that is co-signed by both the data space leader and respective lab leader. All data and machines in the lab will be irrevocably destroyed in this process, and neither data nor machines can be recreated.

### Resources

#### If we add a new lab to our data space, how will this affect our resource consumption? 

Each new lab requires dedicated storage and compute resources since data and users are separated between the environments. Related to prices, you need to plan for one lab subscription, one lab machine and at least 1 terabyte storage for each lab. 

#### Can we share resources inside my data space? 

To a certain extent. Each lab has individual allocations of compute and storage resources to keep data and use segregated for privacy and security measures. 


#### Can we share resources inside one of our labs? 

Yes. Storage and compute resources are shared among all lab users inside the same lab. This means that all lab users can access all data and all compute resources inside the same lab.
