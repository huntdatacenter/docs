## Subscriptions

### Who decide which subscription level we can utilize? 

You. The decision to choose a WHITE, ORANGE or BLUE subscription level is fully up to you and your data space leader. Head over to the [services overview](/administer-science/services/overview/#data-space-subscription) to see the differences between them. 



## Compute

### Are entry machines metered? 

No. Entry machines are the machines we use to control the user management and security updates in individual labs. These are mandatory and the cost is included in lab subscription fees. You should -not- include the cost for these machines in your [price calculator](/administer-science/prices/calculator/) estimates.

### Can we upsize a commitment machine with on-demand resources? 

Yes, that's the aim. We acknowledge that you may have a need for increased computational resources in periods of the year, and that one convenient setup would be to upsize your home machine for such compute efforts. Our aim is to allow such upgrades. 

### How do we ensure that on-demand machines are deactivated when not needed? 

On-demand resources runs until a deactivation notice from the a lab user. To save cost, [contact us](/contact) for deactivation when the machine is no longer needed. The meter stops the day we get the notification.




## Storage

### Which terabyte price will each lab pay for their storage? 

Each lab pay the mean terabyte price for your data space. We automatically calculate the volume discount for your data space and use this set the mean terabyte price for your data space. For details, see the meter, cost and billing section under the Store chapter in the [services specification](/administer-science/services/specifications/) and the Store section in the [price list](/administer-science/prices/pricelist/), or test for yourself in the [price calculator](/administer-science/prices/calculator/). 

### Why is one terabyte the minimum storage allocation? 

We try ensure a consistent storage performance by linking usage to the overall system capacity. One of these controls is to ensure that the total number of spinning disks scale with the need for increased input/output operations of actual use. The one terabyte minimum allocation helps us to achieve this.

### Why to we see less storage on our machines that we pay for? 

The volumes sizes that you see on your machines are slightly less that the volume sizes that you claim. This is expected. [Read why here](/administer-science/data/faq/#why-is-volume-sizes-less-than-claimed).

### How is storage reduction metered? 

You can indirectly reduce the size of your storage volume by moving data to a new smaller volume ([see the steps here](/administer-science/data/faq/#can-we-reduce-the-size-of-existing-volumes)). During such procedures, both volumes are metered until you request deletion of the original volume in the service desk.


## Billing 

### Can we have several invoice profiles under our data space? 

Yes, you may add separate invoice profiles for individual labs under your data space in the data space management section of our [service desk](/administer-science/service-desk/data-space-orders/#new-invoice-profile). All accrued costs for the specified labs (one or more) will then be invoiced to the new profile. 

### How can we update the account information on the invoice profile? 

You may update existing invoice profiles in the data space management section of our [service desk](/administer-science/service-desk/data-space-orders/#update-existing-invoice-profile)

### When should we expect our invoices? 

We aim to ship invoices after each quarter. The first invoices under the new services model is planned shipped in the last week of October 2022.

### When should we expect commit services to be invoices? 

You should expect the initial invoice for data space subscriptions, lab subscriptions and 1Y/3Y commitments of machines and storage to be in the next quarter after your lab deployment. Usage of various services will be combined into one invoice expected to be sent quarterly. Invoice details for each service is specified in the [services specification](/administer-science/services/specifications/) under the "Billing" sections. 

### I am invoiced too much, now what? 

Oh, we are truly sorry. This may happen from time to time. Our invoice process automatically process services orders. From time to time, this may lead to discrepancies between expected and invoice amount. [Contact us](/contact) for a review. For inaccuracies attributable to us, we will issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. The process is specified in the HUNT Cloud Services Agreement that we are holding with your service center.
