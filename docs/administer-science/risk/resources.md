### [Statement of applicability (SoA)](/certificates/)

This is the document that states the implementation status of the individual security and privacy controls specified in our policy documents. In other words, the SoA is what we state we have implemented, and such a good reference points for your audits to check if our implementation meet your expectations. 


### [ISO certificates](/certificates/)

ISO certificates provides verification from a third-party that we comply with the requirements in the international standards as stated in our SoA. We hold certificates for information security (ISO 27001) and quality (ISO 9001).
