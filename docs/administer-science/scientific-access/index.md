## Background

We have five agreement layers in HUNT Cloud (illustration below). This guide covers Data space orders and Lab orders that need to be in place before you can onboard your scientists and data explorers.

!["Illustration of five agreement layers in HUNT Cloud with data processor agreements and service center agreements highlighted with a red frame since they are placed on the organizational level."](./images/hunt-cloud-agreement-layers-data-space-and-lab.png)

::: warning Organizational access

You scientific access agreements are attached to your organizations access agreements. Thus, your department or organization need to activate [organizational access](/govern-science/organizational-access/) to HUNT Cloud before you can start your scientific onboarding. [Contact us](/administer-science/contact) if you need to start an organizational onboarding. 

:::

## Service orders

Data space orders and Lab orders are formally attached to your organization's [Service center agreement](/govern-science/organizational-access/#service-center-agreement) as Service orders. These orders defines the type of services you request and those at your side that are responsible for services.


### Data space order

**A Data space in HUNT Cloud is the administrative unit that coordinate scientific activities across one or many labs. The aim is to simplify your management.** 

Your Data space is the management account where your labs and their attached services are managed, controlled and billed. A Data space subscription is therefore required before individual labs and services can be ordered.

Your Data space does also identify your management team that we interact with to ensure smooth activities across your labs, and your Data space subscription level defines the service level that is available to the labs under your control.

### Lab order

**A Lab in HUNT Cloud is a digital environment (laboratory) where your scientists access their scientific tools and resources for storage, computation and transport. You may attach one to many labs under your Data space.**

By default, a lab consists of a security framework that we control and a home machine where your scientists can store data and run analysis. 

Your lab leader or lab coordinator chooses the initial size of the home machine and the initial storage you want to start with. From there they can adjust the machine size, add additional machines, and expand the storage resources throughout the project period.

**Service center** 

*Define your Service center short name*

We aim to use the acronym of your organization and/or department/division. To illustrate for NTNU departments, your service center name will be `ntnu-ism`, `ntnu-idi` etc. We use this in day-to-day communication, on reports that we send you and such.

*Identify your Service center leader*

We aim to use an individual that is responsible for the scientific activities under your service center. To illustrate for NTNU departments, your service center leader will be the Deputy head of Research (Nestleder forskning) at your Department.

**Data space name**

We recommend that you invest some time to identify a short and powerful name for your data space. Name recognition may help strengthen your scientific brand when you communicate with colleagues, collaborators and other interested parties. 

*Data space short name*

We will use your Data space short name in communication with your team and when we communicate with your department and faculty. Abbreviation of centers, groups and labs are often used. 

*Data space full name*

This is the official name that we will use in reports, invoices and similar.

**Data space leader**

This is the individual that is authorized to make decisions for all labs in the Data space and pay fees for the accrued costs under the Data space. Scientific center leaders and/or principal investigator do often hold this role.

**Administrator roles**

You have the option to list specific individuals as our point-of-contact for dialogues on agreements, data, technologies, training of new users and financial aspects. Leave this field BLANK if you would like the Data space leader to hold this role.
 
For larger center and groups, we see these roles as senior positions that administer and ensures a common practice for e.g. your data handling across your many labs and collaborations. [Click here](/administer-science/roles) to read more about the different roles.

**Subscription level**

*Subscription level*

Your Data space subscription level decide the degrees of freedom for your scientists. Our [services overview](/administer-science/services/overview#data-space) provides a summary of different features, the [services specifications](/administer-science/services/specifications) holds the detailed description, and the [price list](/administer-science/prices/pricelist) specify the yearly cost.

We recommend that you start with the free-of-charge WHITE subscription level if you are unsure of which level you should choose as you may easily upgrade this later. [Contact us](/administer-science/contact) if you need guidance in your selection process.

*Subscription length*

You may choose 1 or 3 year subscription length. The cost of your subscription will be metered in full on your first invoice.

**Signatures**

You need to get a signature from the Service center leader, typically by saving the PDF and forwarding it on email -after- you have completed the remaining pages, and then you need to get the signature of the Data space leader.

**Great work! Now let's jump to the Invoice profile form.**
:::


::: details Invoice profile decision support

The Invoice profile specify where accrued costs for you Data space and attached labs should be invoiced. You need at least one Invoice profile to get going.
