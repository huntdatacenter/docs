# Administrative roles in HUNT Cloud

**Each data space appoints scientific administrators to the following key responsibility areas: compliance, data, technology, training and finance. These individuals are the point of contact for lab users in the data space and us when it comes to administrative issues and improvements.**


[[toc]]

The goals for the development of these roles are to simplify knowledge transfers for key areas between labs within one data space, to bridge knowledge transfers between scientific administrators across data spaces, to structure feedback on our administrative activities, and to jointly develop and identity and champion the importance of scientific administrators in high-impact data-driven science.

Your scientific administrators are named in your [data space order](/administer-science/agreements/overview#data-space-order). All administrators are invited to the [data space ting](/govern-science/tingweek/).

## Data space roles
