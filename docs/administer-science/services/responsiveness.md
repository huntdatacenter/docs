# Responsiveness

**This page lists expected responsiveness from request to delivery for selected services under normal conditions. Ping us if things takes longer than expected.**

For the record, we are a small team with tasks distributed among our members. We do expect our responsiveness and delivery times to increase during unplanned and planned leaves, holidays, high demand periods etc.
