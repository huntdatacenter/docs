## Data space subscriptions

Data spaces establishes a management account (data space) in HUNT Cloud where individual labs are attached and their resources managed, controlled and billed.

We have established two subscription levels, EXPLORE and EVOLVE. Both are free of charge. They differ in our internal follow-up as EXPLORE are aimed at larger units and EVOLVE are aimed at scientific groups and centers.

| Subscription levels: | EXPLORE | EVOLVE |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Cost | Free | Free |
| Maximum attached labs | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Maximum commitment length | 3 YEARS | 3 YEARS | 3 YEAR |
| Storage volume discount* | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |
| Multiple billing accounts | ![no](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |

*) Volume discounts for storage is calculated across all resources attached to one data space. 


### Lab subscription

**This is the subscription that gives to access to one digital laboratory where you add resources for computation and storage.**

One to many labs can be organized under one data space. 

| Subscription level: | LAB |
| ---- | ---- |
| Commitment length | 1 or 3 YEARS |
| Number of users per lab   | Unlimited |

| Free external exports | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | 
| Access to new pilot services | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | 

*) Restore against accidental deletion is activate for work and archive volumes on home machines.

## Individual services

### Compute

This is the service that deploys one to many virtual machines for data analysis in labs. The service allows you to deploy both short term and long term [machine types](/administer-science/services/machine-types) of various sizes.


### Storage

This is the service that deploy storage resources to virtual machines in labs. The default service allows you to attach one to many storage volumes (disks) to your lab machines.

| Subscription levels: | LAB | 
| ---- | ---- |
| Restore* | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | 
| Expandable storage | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | 
| Regular storage (hard drives) | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | 
| Speed-optimized storage (NVMe) | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | 
| Tape storage | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | 
| Volume discount** | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | 

*) Restore against accidental deletion is activate for work and archive volumes on home machines.

**) Volume discounts for storage is calculated across all resources attached to one data space. 



### Transfer

This is the service that enables compliant data transfers to and from labs, both between labs inside HUNT Cloud and to and from parties outside HUNT Cloud.

| Subscription levels: | LAB| 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Free internal transfers | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |
| Free external imports | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |
| Free external exports | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |
| Free network openings | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |
