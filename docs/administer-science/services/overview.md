## Subscriptions

Our subscriptions forms the frame where you attach resources for computation, storage and transportation. See [Services specifications](/services/specifications) for detailed information.


### Data space

This is the subscription that establishes a management account (data space) in HUNT Cloud where individual labs are attached and their resources managed, controlled and billed. We have established three subscription levels that differs in the individual service availability, resource prioritixation, ting membership and costs for individual resources: 

| Subscription levels: | WHITE | ORANGE | BLUE |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Subscription type | Basic | Standard | Premium | 
| Maximum attached labs | 2 | 10 | 20 |
| Maximum commitment length | 3 YEARS | 3 YEARS | 1 YEAR |
| Deploy COMMITMENT machines | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |

*) Restore against accidental deletion is activate for work and archive volumes on home machines.

**) Volume discounts for storage is calculated across all resources attached to one data space. 



### Lab

This is the subscription that gives to access to one digital laboratory where you add resources for computation and storage. One to many labs can be organized under one data space. The availability of certain resources are defined by the subscription level of the data space for which the lab is attached (see above). See the [Services specifications](/services/specifications) for detailed information.

| Subscription level: | LAB |
| ---- | ---- |
| Commitment length | 1 or 3 YEARS |

## Individual services

### Secure

This is the default service that deploys the security and compliance framework for your lab. The default configuration is tailored for processing of sensitive research information. Adjustments may be made to further strengthen the security.

### Compute

This is the service that deploys one to many virtual machines for data analysis in labs. The service allows you to deploy both short term and long term [machine types](/services/machine-types) of various sizes.

| Subscription levels: | WHITE | ORANGE | BLUE |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Deploy COMMITMENT machines | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |
| Deploy ON-DEMAND machines | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |

| Deploy custom machines types | ![no](./images/no-30.png "no") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |


### Store

This is the service that deploy storage resources to virtual machines in labs. The default service allows you to attach one to many storage volumes (disks) to your lab machines.

| Subscription levels: | WHITE | ORANGE | BLUE |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Restore* | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |

| Volume discount** | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |

*) Restore against accidental deletion is activate for work and archive volumes on home machines.

**) Volume discounts for storage is calculated across all resources attached to one data space. 



### Transfer

This is the service that enables compliant data transfers to and from labs, both between labs inside HUNT Cloud and to and from parties outside HUNT Cloud.

| Subscription levels: | WHITE | ORANGE | BLUE |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Free internal transfers | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |
| Free external imports | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |
| Free external exports | ![no](./images/no-30.png "no") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |




### Others

So far, this is the Tape service that allow you to write encrypted tapes for offline and offsite preservation of your high value data.

| Subscription levels: | WHITE | ORANGE | BLUE |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Tape service availability | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") | ![yes](./images/yes-30.png "yes") |
