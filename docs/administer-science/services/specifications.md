List of individual changes:

*Data space subscriptions*

* EXPLORE and EVOLVE are introduced as new data space subscription levels to improve lab portfolio management under a data space.
* EXPLORE is aimed at departments and division with the intention that scientists quickly can establish their own lab.
* EVOLVE is aimed at scientific groups where lab leaders can control more than one lab.
* Cost is removed from the subscription layers to allow for improved movement between subscriptions.
* The previous subscription levels WHITE, ORANGE and BLUE are removed.

::: tip For clarification
Data spaces on the BLUE subscription can keep their BLUE services for their full 12 months subscription period if they prefer these over the new services.
