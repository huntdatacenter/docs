# Tape Archive

Following guide is meant to help you archive your data using simple bash commands and afterwards send it to us using internal [kista](/administer-science/service-desk/lab-orders#internal-kista) where we can collect the data and store it on a long term tape medium.

::: warning Attention
This is a pilot service for tape archiving. [Contact us](https://docs.hdc.ntnu.no/about/contact/) for further information.

:::

### 1. Identification of data

1.1 Identify what data you want stored on the tape. Mark down whole directories. Generally, we expect your data to be stored in `/mnt/archive` directory

1.2 Do you use symbolic links ? If you are not sure, you can identify symlink directories by first letter in permission string. Letter l stands for a symbolic link. You can also use command below to count your symlinks. If output is other than 0, contact us on slack for further instructions.

Example:

```bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root    root      28 Mar 21 07:59 test-symbolic-link -> /path/of/symbolic-link/
```

Command:

```bash
ls -lR /mnt/archive | grep ^l |wc -l
```

### 2. Compress data using tar

2.1 Check disk space available with command below.

```bash
df -H
```

For compression of data we will use tar command and store archive in **/lab/scratch** directory.

2.2 Create a file_list text file of all files you want to save using below command.

```bash
find -L /mnt/archive -not -type d >  labname-filelist.txt # this will check /mnt/archive directory and list all files.
```

Options used:
-c: Create an archive.
-z: Compress the archive with gzip.
-v: Display progress in the terminal while creating the archive, also known as “verbose” mode. (optional)
-f: Allows you to specify the filename of the archive.
-h: Follow symlinks; archive and dump the files they point to. (optional)

Examples:

```bash
tar -czvf single_file.tar.gz /mnt/archive/data.dta    # single file or directory
```

```bash
tar -chzvf archive_symlink.tar.gz /mnt/archive    # includes symbolic links
```

```bash
tar -czvf archive_multiple_dir.tar.gz /mnt/archive/test.txt /mnt/scratch/data.dta  # compress multiple directories
```

```bash
tar -czvf excluded_files.tar.gz /mnt/archive --exclude=/mnt/archive/test/data.txt --exclude=/mnt/archive/test1/data1.txt # excludes specified directories
```

3. Hash the data

Once you have compressed your files, you need to create a hash of the files using sha256sum command.

single hash:

```bash
sha256sum your_archive.tar.gz > hash_archive.txt
```

4. Upload compressed data, hash file and file_list.txt to [kista](/administer-science/service-desk/lab-orders#internal-kista).
