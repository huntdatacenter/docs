# Administrative agreements

**We believe a solid framework of documented responsibilities is a key success factor to enable your scientists with the freedom to explore. This page holds an overview of the administrative agreements in HUNT Cloud.** 


As a coordinator you will balance a backstage agreement framework that is somewhat complex. Bear with us, once up and running it will provide you with significant powers.

## Overview


Our activities are organized in the following agreement hierarchy: 

![Unit hierarchy](../services/images/hunt-cloud-service-units-overview.png "HUNT Cloud unit hierarchy")

1. The **Data controller** is your organizational unit that control your data ownership and data protection inside our services, in short the data processing. The *Data processor agreement* control these activities and is therefore placed on top of our agreement hierarchy. All other arrangements between us are incorporated into this agreement as amendments.
2. The **Services center** is your organizational unit that control the cloud services that you consume. The *Services agreement* details our services specifications and conditions for resource consumption, cost and billing. One or many services centers can be attached to a data processor agreement. 
3. The **Data space** is your research unit that manages scientific activities across one to many labs. The *Data space order* specify cross-lab coordinators and the subscription level that defines services availability. One or many data spaces can be attached to one services center.
4. The **Lab** is your digital laboratory where your get access to cloud resources for storage, computation and transport of data. The *Lab order* specify a lab leader and lab coordinator that can allocate resources and authorize users inside their lab. One or many labs can be attached to one data space.
5. The **Lab user** is a scientist that can access data and cloud services in one lab. The *Lab user agreement* specify the acceptable use policy for our services. One or many lab users can be attached to one lab. One lab user can be attached to more than one lab, each such authorization requires a unique lab user agreement.

We will need all agreement levels in place before to activate your new lab environment. 

We know, this is lots of papers. On the bright side, although complex at the first glance, the prepared structure provides a solid framework for flexibility. 

And keep in mind, the more layers already in place, the simpler it is to get compliant labs up and running. 



















## Data processor agreement

The data processor agreement is on top of our agreement hierarchy because it regulates one of the most important asset in digital science: your trustworthiness towards your research participants (data protection and data privacy).

The remaining agreements on this page are therefore formally incorporated into the data processor agreement as attachments. 

### About

In short, the data processor agreement defines that your organization owns the data that you upload and generate in HUNT Cloud. And it specifies privacy and security controls that are to be in place to protect your data. 

The data processor agreement allows your research to be compliant with the Data Protection Directive from EU (GDPR) and relevant Norwegian laws and regulations, including partly compliance with the Norwegian «*Norm for informasjonssikkerhet*».

### Signatories

The data processor agreement is formally agreed between your host organization that control your data (data controller), and our host institution that process the data on your behalf (data processor). 

Your signatory will be the individual that is authorize to control your data on behalf of your organization. This may range from top management via head of departments to individuals in various organizational units.

::: tip

For NTNU, we recommend Head of Departments as signatories on our internal data processor agreements (see 'enighetsavtale' below).

:::



Our signatory will be the Head of Department at our department, the [Department of Public Health and Nursing](https://www.ntnu.no/ism/ledelse) at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, NTNU. 

### Getting started

We need to ensure that we have an active data processor agreement with your host organization or department (for NTNU) before we can process your data space and lab orders. Head over to the [get going](/administer-science/get-going/data-processor) section for a step-by-step guide on how to start.

### Agreements within NTNU

Data processor agreements are agreed between enterprises. This means that we cannot sign data processor agreements between NTNU departments. 

To allow for documented security measures, we have therefore developed a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) for internal data processing that we call "enighetsavtale". We sign these at the Department level. 

The document clarifies the same rights and protections as our regular processor agreement with one exception: Disputes will be resolved with binding effect by NTNU's management with our Rector as the last instance.

### Data subprocessor agreement

Sometimes you may be processing data on behalf of others. This is the case when the processing purpose if defined by another organization than your host organization (contract research). 

To illustrate, this may be the case if you provide analytical expertise to a project that is controlled/managed by another organization, and you want to transfer their data to your lab to take advantage of your established tools and resources.

In such circumstances your data provider may be the "data controller" and you may be the "data processor". If so, HUNT Cloud may be the "data subprocessor" (data underbehandler). We have dedicated agreement templates for such setups that gets defined under "Agreement type" in the agreement form fields (see required information above). 

[Contact us](/contact) if you wonder which of the two agreement types that fits your processing needs.

### Custom processing templates

Your host organization may prefer to use their own data processing agreement template. This is fine with us as long as the template is compliant with requirements set forth in GDPR, other relevant laws, ISO 27001 and 27701, and that we are able to comply with your organization's security requirements. 

Note that such templates will need involvement from legal teams from both sides. [Contact us](/contact) for time estimates of such arrangements.





















## Services agreement

The services agreement regulates how cloud resources are controlled and billed across data spaces and labs. 

The aim of this agreement is to establish a unified way to control services and resources, and to simplify the establishments of data spaces and labs attached to the this agreement.

### About

The services agreement regulates conditions related to the use of our cloud services. This includes specifications of the services, support responsiveness and service levels. The agreement do also specify cost, metering and billing.The following attachments are included to the agreement: 

- services specifications
- service levels
- price list
- list of attached data spaces and labs
- data space order template
- lab order template
- user agreement template
- contact list

### Signatories

The services agreement is signed by the services center leader, your data controller and us. The signatory level depends on your organization. Services agreement may be signed on the same level as data processor agreements, data spaces or somewhere in between.

::: tip NTNU

For NTNU, services agreements are signed at the Department level with Deputy Head of Department for Research as Center leader.

:::

### Getting started

We need to ensure that we have an active service center agreement to attach your data space and lab orders.

## Data space order

The intention of the data space is to simplify management of several labs under one scientific center or research group. The structure allow for roles, controls and reporting to be unified across a lab portfolio.

### About

The agreement specifies a data space that is attached to a services center. The data space list roles and define access to cloud resources that is unified across all labs that are attached to the data space. The aim is to simplify responsibilities, communication and reporting across many labs.

The data space order is co-signed by the services center leader and the data space leader.

### Invoice profile

Each data space needs to specify at least one invoice porfile where services gets billed. Depending on your data space subscription, you can establish several profiles (BLUE subscription layer). [Click here](/administer-science/agreements/downloads/#data-space-order) to download the form. 

### Getting started

We need to ensure that we have an active services center agreement with your host organization or department (for NTNU) before we can process your data space order.

When the services agreement are in place, it's quite simple to order a data space: (1) Download the [data space order](/administer-science/agreements/downloads/#data-space-order) and the [invoice profile](/administer-science/agreements/downloads/#invoice-profile), (2) fill in the fields (descriptions on the download page), (3) and send the order and invoice profile to us via the service center section in our [service desk](/service-desk/service-center-orders/#new-data-space).






## Lab order

The lab order is used to establish a digital laboratory where you can store and analyze data.

### About

The lab order specifies the name of the lab, under which data space the lab is attached, names and contact information for the lab leader and the lab coordinator. 

The lab coordinator is authorized by the lab leader to approve certain tasks, such as allocate or upgrade resources and order internal kistas. 

The agreement do includes GDPR related fields such as purpose of the processing in your lab. We use this information to provide an overview to data spaces and data controllers for processes under their control.

The lab order agreement is signed by the data space leader and the lab leader (third-party verification).
