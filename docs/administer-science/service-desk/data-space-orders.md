## Lab management

### New lab

Click the button below to order a new lab under your existing data space.

<SDButton form="request_new_lab" />

* **Who can order:** Data space leaders and data space compliance administrators in active data spaces, and lab leader for new labs.
* **Required attachment**: [A signed lab order](/administer-science/agreements/downloads#lab-order) and information on storage volume sizes and machine type for the home machine (see below).
* **Expected delivery time:** One week.
* **Next step**: [Add your first lab users](/administer-science/service-desk/lab-orders.html#add-a-new-lab-user).
* **Cost:** One lab subscription as specified in the [Services specifications](/administer-science/services/specifications) and [Price list](/administer-science/prices/pricelist).

::: warning Next: Add your first lab user(s)

It's important that you order lab access for each scientist (lab user) that will work in your lab as soon as you send us the above Lab order. Without these, your scientists will not be able to access your new lab.

[Click on this link to get going](/administer-science/service-desk/lab-orders#add-a-new-lab-user).

::: details More on the required resource specifications

Your lab comes with one (1) machine with computational resources and attached storage by default. We call this your **`home`**-machine.

**Machine type**

For cost savings, we recommend that you start with the **`default.b2`** machine type. And if needed, upgrade to larger machine types when your scientists are well onboard in your new lab and ready to explore. You may specify [alternative machines types](/administer-science/services/machine-types) in the order if you know you need other sizes right away.

**Storage volumes**

Your lab comes with three (3) storage volumes attached to your home machine. We have suggested default sizes on these volumes that you may want to change.

*Volume types*

i) the **`archive`** volume is tailored for data storage, such as your raw data and results;
ii) the **`work`** volume is tailored for your data in your day-to-day activities that your want to preserve, such as code files; and iii) the **`scratch`** volume is tailored for temporary analytical files, such typically generated in intermediate steps of your analysis. Note that the **`scratch`** volume do -not- include our restore service (backup).

*Volume sizes*

The minimum storage allocation of the three volumes is 1000 Gigabytes (1 Terabyte). We have suggested a default allocation that you may update if you like:

ARCHIVE = 400
WORK = 300
SCRATCH = 300

The above numbers are in Gigabytes (1000 Gigabytes = 1 Terabyte). To illustrate, if you want your archive volume to be 2 Terabyte, specify **`ARCHIVE = 2000`** in your order.

**More information**

See the "Lab" section in our [Services specifications](/administer-science/services/specifications) for more information on the lab service and default configuration. [Contact us](/contact) if you need guidance on the size selection.
