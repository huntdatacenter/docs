# Get going

**This section provides step-by-step guides on how to get going with your agreements in HUNT Cloud. The guide is intended for compliance coordinators that handles practical aspects of the scientific coordination on behalf of their organizations and/or scientific groups.**

We have four administrative layers in HUNT Cloud: data controllers, service centers, data spaces and labs. These pages guides you through the required agreements and decision points for each level.


### Data controller

[Click here to get going as a data controller in HUNT Cloud](/administer-science/get-going/data-controller). 

Data controllers in HUNT Cloud are organizations or organizational units that control data that are processes in our systems. This processing is controlled in Data Processor Agreements (DPA) between your organization and our organization (NTNU).

### Service centers

[Click here to get going with your first service center](/administer-science/get-going/service-center). 

Service centers in HUNT Cloud are organizational units that control the overarching scientific activities and cloud services within data spaces, typically Departments at the Universities. Services are controller in services agreements that details services specifications, conditions for resource consumption, cost and billing.

### Data spaces

[Click here to get going with your first data space](/administer-science/get-going/data-space). 

Data spaces in HUNT Cloud are research units that coordinate scientific activities across one or many labs. Data spaces identify cross-lab coordinators that help us to ensure smooth scientific activities. Data spaces are controlled in data space orders that specify subscription levels for available resources in labs. 

### Labs

[Click here to get going with your first lab](/administer-science/get-going/lab). 

Labs in HUNT Cloud are digital environments (laboratories) where scientists access scientific tools and allocated cloud resources for storage, computation and transport. Labs are controlled in lab orders that specify lab leaders and coordinators that can authorize lab users and adjust resources.
