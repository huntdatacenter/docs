# Get going as a data controller

**This guide aims to describe the steps to get you going as a data controller in HUNT Cloud.**

The data processor agreement controls the privacy and security controls for your data in HUNT Cloud. Therefore, we need to ensure that this agreement is in place before we can move the other agreement types forward.

Good to know, there is no cost associated with the establishment of a data processor agreement, and we have solid templates available to for a quick process. You can read more about the data processor agreements in the [agreement section](/agreements/overview/#data-processor-agreement). 


### 1. Is there already a data processor agreement in place between my organization and HUNT Cloud?

Ask inside your organization or [contact us](/contact) if you are unsure. If an agreement is already in place, your might skip this guide and move directly to the [service center guide](/coordination/get-going/service-center).

Depending on your organization, data processor agreements may be signed on various organizational levels. For example, your Department will be the internal data controller at NTNU. 

### 2. Which agreement type do I need?

(2.1) [Data processor agreements](/agreements/overview/#data-processor-agreement): This is the "normal" type that regulates situations where you and your organization controls the data and defines the purpose of the processing.

(2.2.) [Data sub-processor agreements](/agreements/overview/#data-subprocessor-agreement): This is when the purpose of the processing is decided by an organization that is not your own, for example contract research. The organization that controls the data may add requirements for privacy and security measures that we will need to incorporate in the sub-processor agreement.

### 3. Which other agreement types outside HUNT Cloud may be required?

**Do you plan to use data from external data providers?** If you take on responsibility as the data controller, such transfers is often regulated in data export agreements or licenses that includes requirements for information security. [Contact us](/contact) us for compliance evaluations if you are unsure if specified requirements are covered in our agreements or services.
