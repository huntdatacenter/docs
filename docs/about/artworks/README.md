## Introduction

*«There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the cloud.»*

It's hard to imagine that Gilbert Chesterton aimed at digital clouds when he constructed his famous paradox more than a century ago. Regardless, the quote inspired us to explore an area where truly only your dreams and imaginations defines the boundaries - art.

The field of data science is filled with abstract ideas that are hard to grasp and harder to discuss, such as data value, data space, clouds and ethical dimensions.

Our aim is to visualize ideas and concepts into practical forms that make the abstract world of data science more understandable. And maybe contributing a tiny bit of soul and identity to the field on the way.

We are truly appreciative that digital artist Ingunn B. Ferstad entered the fascinating field of data sciences, and on her way established and evolved the exciting world that ends up in these artworks.

### Bottle of knowledge

Knowledge is the currency in science. This is what we seek with our explorations. It's derived from data. It's not oil nor gold, although it resembles some of the same characteristics. It's essential to keep it flowing as knowledge empowers both your personal career and our joint journey towards a better world.

We use this image to illustrate, 

* that new **knowledge is the goal** of data explorations and what our scientists tireless seeks.
* that **flow** is essential in knowledge generation (we are using liquid metaphors). 
* that **data is the raw material** that goes into the production of knowledge.
* that **data differ qualitatively from oil and gold**, for example in duration and monitization, although some are partly similar (needs refinements, end products holds high value).

### The keymakers

High impact science is about exploring the unknown. You will meet previously unopened doors on these journeys. Unpicking the most difficult locks requires custom keys. These are often carefully crafted, blending wisdom from humanities, social sciences, technologies and administration. Helpers from these fields are your keymakers.

We use this image to illustrate that, 

* high-impact science on sensitive data do often **explore data and methods in new ways** not previously done.
* such innovative activities often will meet **new challenges in legal, ethical and/or technological areas** that have not been previously solved.
* **flow in such projects is often dependant on new or customized solutions** in legal, ethical or technological areas.
* that **other areas of humanities** and social sciences such as language (e.g. choice of words) and writing (understandable across domains), art, history and cultural context (anthropology) and similar areas often are key to communicate new ideas in trustworthy ways to interested parties.
* **identifying and recruiting your team of helpers** (keymakers) is essensial to keep complex projects moving.
* we see **scientific coordinators** as the driving force and orchestrators of the custom keymaking process.

We use this image to illustrate that,

* **solutions to common problems may already be available**, for example agreed security measures for specific data providers, predefined agreement setups, machine learning equipment, software solutions and so forth;
* we work hard to continously **develop and evolve stock solutions** together with our cloud community;
* our goal is to **make all stock solutions available to all users as soon as possible** to elevate activities for as many of you as possible.

### Pink clouds

Imagine a new world. Kind of familiar, kind of different. Where digital laboratories are built on floating islands. Where you are the explorer, and the sky holds no limit. Welcome to HUNT Cloud.

We use this image to illustrate that, 

* we see our scientists as **explorers**;
* their **new world** looks kind of familiar (grass, trees, clouds) and kind of different (floating islands, pink clouds, day/night sky at the same time). Both scientists, scientific coordinators and scientific leaders should expect to spend some time to know their new world well;
* we see **data spaces as floating islands** up in the skys, and that getting a new data space is for us a bit like **getting your own island**. This is the place where your establish and organize your labs and scientific activities;
* we see **labs as buildings on the floating islands**. You can have have one to many such buildings (labs) on your data space;
* **ideas** travel between labs and data spaces with a little help scientific coordinators and our cloud community (illustrated with flower seeds in the lower left corner).
