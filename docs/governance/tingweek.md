# Ting week

**We appoint time three times per year to meet for information, feedback and discussions on how to develop the services in HUNT Cloud to better elevate science. We call these gatherings Tings.**

We arrange a layered set of Tings for distinct groups in our community. The meetings are spread out over one week in the winter, spring and autumn. We call these weeks "Ting weeks".

## Reports

The intent of the Ting report is to give you the opportunity to read up on **what** we are doing at HUNT Cloud, and a little bit on **why** we do it. All so we can meet at the tings and have informed discussions on how to best elevate data for a better world!

The reports include a letter with reflections from the last Ting period as well as chapters with business description, risk factors, description of properties, and external and internal controls.

## Tings

We have implemented a layered Ting structure to elevate voices and collective knowledge from distinct groups within the community. As of today, we appoint time for four different Tings that meet during the Ting weeks:

![Tingweek tings](./images/tingweek-tings.png)

### Lab ting

This is our allting were we focuses on the **user experience inside labs**, and communication between lab users and with us. All active lab users, lab leaders and lab coordinators are invited for information, feedback and discussions on all aspects of existing, planned and future services.

### Data space ting

This is the Ting where we appoint time to evolve scientific organization and **cross-lab coordination in data spaces**, including coordination of compliance, data, technologies, knowledge and financial aspects. The original Coordinator ting changed name to Data space ting in Ting week #5 to reflect contractual roles in the new services model.

### Enterprise ting

This is the Ting where we appoint time to meet with users from or affiliated with **private institutions**. We have a special focus on issues that is relevant for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and larger contract research non-profit institutions.

### Lagtun

Lagtun is the Ting where we appoint time for cross-organizational discussions among **data controllers, service centers and large data spaces** in the community. This Ting gives direct advice on our strategic and tactical development to the HUNT Cloud management. [Read more](/tingweek/lagtun/).



## Memberships

## FAQ

#### Why Tings?

The inspiration to appoint time to meet at regular intervals in a layered structure is drawn from the Old Norse [ting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_(assembly)#Etymology) structures such as [Frostating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostating) here in Tr√∏ndelag. The intention is to ensure regular discussions on how we together best can elevate data for a better world, including feedback on how to best adapt and evolve the scientific toolbox of HUNT Cloud to better support your scientific journey.

#### Is this an assembly?

No. Our tings are not the same as a general assembly (generalforsamling) with binding decisions. As of today, our tings are to be seen as a gathering of people that both champion and dream up ideas on how to best utilize data for a better world. HUNT Cloud is owned by NTNU which has the full financial and compliance responsibilities for our services.

#### How do I get invited?

Ting invitations, agenda and digital meeting links are forwarded on email a few weeks before the Ting week. Dates will also be announced on these pages and on Slack.

#### Where do we meet?

We will meet digitally at Zoom utilizing the NTNU subscription. Links will be forwarded on email and on Slack for the lab ting.

#### Where are the minutes?

Our tings have public agendas and internal minutes. We write up a summary after the week that gets distributed directly to the invited parties. The summary contains statements from all tings.
