The aim is to ease the onboarding and support the written information.

This means that environments that are inactive for more than 10 days will be shut down.</li></ul></details> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>Administer science</summary> <h3>Major changes</h3> <p><strong>Storage performance configuration</strong></p> <p>We noticed substantial performance reduction on our  block storage configuration in Cloud2 as the usage increased over the summer.</p> <p>After spending a significant amount of time identifying the root cause, we are now adding several measure to increase the system predictability.</p> <p>As part of this, we have started to move current storage volumes over to new configurations. Labs will be contacted to schedule such updates with approximately one day downtime during implementation.</p> <p>As a next step we plan to differentiate on different storage types/performance in our services specification and price list.</p> <h3>Minor changes</h3> <p><strong>Migration milestone</strong></p> <p>More than half of all labs are now migrated from Cloud1 to Cloud2. After a small pause due to the storage performance issues, we have now resumed the migration. Remaining labs will be contacted to schedule their move to limit the downtime of scientific activities.</p></details> <details class="custom-block details"><summary>Govern science</summary> <h3>Major changes</h3> <p><strong>Updated policy ownership</strong></p> <p>The ownership of our <a href="/govern-science/policies/#security-and-privacy-management-policy">Security and privacy management policy</a> is moved from the Head of HUNT Research Centre to the Head of HUNT Cloud as part of an internal reorganization.</p> <p><strong>New quality policy</strong></p> <p>We have established a new <a href="/govern-science/policies/#quality-policy">Quality policy</a> independent from HUNT Research Centre as part of the effort towards our own ISO/IEC 9001 certificate in Quality management.

For example, Services specification version <code>2.8</code> will be listed as <code>2</code>.</p> <p>A major services agreement update indicates that services are changes in a way that need major agreement updates. Such updates are forwarded to all contractual partners on email, and major changes on existing services take effect 90 days after the announcement.</p> <h4 id="minor-services-agreement-update"><a href="#minor-services-agreement-update" class="header-anchor">#</a> Minor services agreement update</h4> <p>The second number indicates which minor <a href="/administer-science/services/specifications/">Services specification</a> version the Patch note are attached to.</p> <p>The number references the second digit of the current Services specification version. For example, Services specification version <code>2.8</code> will be listed as <code>8</code>.</p> <p>A minor services agreement update indicate a change in the agreement text, such as clarifications, syntax updates and similar. These changes takes effect when they are communicated on these docs pages, and are not forwarded to contractual partners on email.</p> <h4 id="patch-notes-number"><a href="#patch-notes-number" class="header-anchor">#</a> Patch notes number</h4> <p>The third number indicates which patch version the current note is attached to. Thus, a patch note is always linked to a specific Service specification version.</p> <p><strong>Major updates</strong></p> <p>Major updates indicates what we think are a substantial update in your user experience of our services.
Such improvements may not always need updates in legal documents.</p> <p><strong>Minor updates</strong></p> <p>Minor Patch notes indicates what we think are small (but often important) user experience updates of our services, for example updates of guides, agreements or other good-to-know-about things.</p> <p><strong>Upcoming features</strong></p> <p>These are features that we have planned to move forward by the time of the notes publication, although they are not always the features that we end up prioritizing over the next period.</p></details></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">10/15/2024</span></div></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"><!----></div></div>
