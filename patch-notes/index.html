For example, Services specification version <code>2.8</code> will be listed as <code>2</code>.</p> <p>A major services agreement update indicates that services are changes in a way that need major agreement updates. Such updates are forwarded to all contractual partners on email, and major changes on existing services take effect 90 days after the announcement.</p> <h4 id="minor-services-agreement-update"><a href="#minor-services-agreement-update" class="header-anchor">#</a> Minor services agreement update</h4> <p>The second number indicates which minor <a href="/administer-science/services/specifications/">Services specification</a> version the Patch note are attached to.</p> <p>The number references the second digit of the current Services specification version. For example, Services specification version <code>2.8</code> will be listed as <code>8</code>.</p> <p>A minor services agreement update indicate a change in the agreement text, such as clarifications, syntax updates and similar. These changes takes effect when they are communicated on these docs pages, and are not forwarded to contractual partners on email.</p> <h4 id="patch-notes-number"><a href="#patch-notes-number" class="header-anchor">#</a> Patch notes number</h4> <p>The third number indicates which patch version the current note is attached to. Thus, a patch note is always linked to a specific Service specification version.</p> <p><strong>Major updates</strong></p> <p>Major updates indicates what we think are a substantial update in your user experience of our services.
Such improvements may not always need updates in legal documents.</p> <p><strong>Minor updates</strong></p> <p>Minor Patch notes indicates what we think are small (but often important) user experience updates of our services, for example updates of guides, agreements or other good-to-know-about things.</p> <p><strong>Upcoming features</strong></p> <p>These are features that we have planned to move forward by the time of the notes publication, although they are not always the features that we end up prioritizing over the next period.</p></details></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">1/23/2025</span></div></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"><!----></div></div>
